Lupe Flores,I am trying to adapt your examples of creating a price histogram. My histogram chart comes up blank.  The price ranges (x) are in 100000- 500000.  Any thoughts,1,11/08/2018 09:48 AM

Kim Pearson,This has been very helpful! My main problem now is getting rid of missing values. Do you know what code I would use to do that for a histogram in ggplot? ,1,25/01/2019 02:47 AM
