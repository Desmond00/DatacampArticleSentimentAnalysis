Billy Hall,great tutorial! Thank you for such detailed and carefully prepared explanations. I would like to try some of these techniques but can't seem to find any link so I can see the structure and format of your source files. Are you planning on adding access to those files?,3,27/06/2018 08:22 AM

Laura C.,"Hi Debbie, thank you so much for these informative and well-researched tutorials! They actually inspired me to start my own work on text mining and topic modelling, currently I'm trying it on a dataset with over 20,000 songs of various genres. I was having some trouble setting up the clean NLP package for POS-tagging, though and was wondering whether you might have any tips or recommendations how to properly connect to the Python or Java back-end? (since for some reason it won't work for me yet, I tried the Spacy library from Python...) ",2,28/09/2018 08:56 PM
