Federico Molina Magne,To read sas files haven package is MUCH faster than sas7bdat,1,28/02/2018 09:22 PM
Dan-Tiberiu Costin,"When dealing with sas files, their seize is often an issue. It would be excellent to include some of the size limitations of these methods.  Concerning the sas files I tested both the `sas7bdat` and the `haven`  packages with better results for the haven package. However there is little documentation that I could find regarding the read_sas() function of the haven package. It works well for small files but what about 50Gb files ?  ",1,29/03/2018 03:33 PM
