Pradip Adword,"Hi Aditya, Thanks for sharing article on autoencoders. I am trying to predict age and gender on biological data. For age, I am using regression algorithm and for gender, I am using classification algorithm. I am trying to combine both algorithm in neural network to get prediction of age and gender at same instance but not sure how to do that. But by using autoencoders it is possible to do predict both in same instance (not sure). Can you please share example or link for the mentioned problem??",2,04/02/2019 05:04 PM
