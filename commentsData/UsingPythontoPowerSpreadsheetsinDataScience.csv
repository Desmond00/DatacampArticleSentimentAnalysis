Bryant Crocker,Great points raised in this article.  I agree that python is the absolute easiest way to to analyze data. Tableau is good contender that I very rarely hear brought up.  Personally I prefer R for data analysis but python is definitely easier to use than R. ,1,13/06/2018 07:07 AM
Keith Win,I am an Excel power user and learning to code Python on datacamp! I'd love to combine the two!  ,2,13/06/2018 07:12 AM
Avinash Navlani,Awesome tutorial with lots of useful information. Thanks Jason Graham.,2,13/06/2018 12:38 PM
Viraj B,The points have been laid down and explained really well. Kudos!,3,18/06/2018 04:30 PM
Alexandra Ijay Kaz,You have put it together so excellently. I am exploring the abilities of Pandas myself. It has been an amazing journey so far.,4,19/06/2018 08:40 PM
Kendra Frederick,"I need to create and manage data collection & analysis tools that other people use. Given the fact (which you mention in an above comment) that far more people are familiar with Excel than with Python or Jupyter, how would you recommend setting up a workflow? Keep data entry in Excel, but transition analysis, visualization, and reporting to Jupyter? That way, most people don't need to learn a new software, and a few people trained in Python can maintain the analysis side of things. Regardless, this article is certainly an inspiration to improve our workflow, despite currently being so reliant on Excel!!",3,19/06/2018 08:47 PM
Saad Afzal,"This is a very relevant article for me. I fell in love with python language when i was first introduced to it by a collegue and since started using my weekends to learn python, pandas etc here on Datacamp. Im an experienced user of Excel vba and i had some procedures which incoming goal seek and loops set up in Excel vba which i tried to replicate in python but i failed badly. There was no way to create a goal seek procedure in python and after several tries I reverted back to excel. Especially one of the procedures with goal seek was so important for my work so I couldn’t see myself working with python. If i someday meet some skilled python programmer I will ask that person to help me create a goal seek procedure until then I am stuck with excel. :(",0,20/06/2018 01:32 AM
jcchidiadi,Excellent article. I love how pandas reduces the number of lines of code needed to do many things. I love the data visualization aspect and learning everyday to be better at python and pandas.,1,20/06/2018 02:52 AM
rehanster,"There are many points in this article where I perk up, crack a huge smile on my face and then take a deep sigh, because there are so (so so) many things I can relate to. ",1,20/06/2018 04:06 PM
Siegfred Balona,"I strongly agree with you on several points. I myself is an advanced Excel user but after spending lots of time with Python and R, I became hooked and switched completely from Excel. Python and R is the absolute go to when it comes to data analysis and data science as a whole.",3,21/06/2018 08:50 PM
David Nealey,Jason this is an excellent review of Excel and Python.  And thanks for the links to other DataCamp and commercial sites.   ,1,29/08/2018 12:43 AM
nickmccarty0,Wes McKinney (the  creator of Pandas) created a data visualization library called Altair that produces dashboards from dataframes for quicker EDA. You should check it out!,2,09/10/2018 06:13 PM
Ulysses Foreman,"Hey Jason I created a few excel reports to my manager after I manipulated the data in pandas. I'm struggling to find data visuals that are richer and easier to format than Excel, have you found plot.ly to be your go to for data visuals?",1,30/03/2019 08:21 PM
Ahmad Rajab,"Brilliant tutorial Jason, I love Excel and Python but have always jumped to the tried and tested spreadsheets/methods rather than switching to Python; you've now inspired me to just do it. I hope you're ok if I reach out to you with queries!",1,20/04/2019 01:11 PM
