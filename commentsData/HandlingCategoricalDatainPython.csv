Michal Lasak,"I believe there's an error in the one-hot encoding/ LabelBinarizer part:  it should be lb_results_df = pd.DataFrame(lb_results, columns=lb.classes_) , as lb_style is not defined anywhere before.",2,24/05/2018 08:50 PM
Joe Bloggs,Some discussion  of categorical embedding using neural networks would help round out the picture.  This was applied successfully in a third place solution to the Rossmann stores competition.  Seems like a great alternative to one-hot with the added benefit of dimensionality reduction.,1,28/05/2018 03:25 PM

Tharika Weerakoon,Hi great guide for categorical data handling. I am wondering whether we can re-convert those encoded categorical data back to original format for the purpose of final result presentation after training the model. ,1,30/04/2019 03:28 PM
