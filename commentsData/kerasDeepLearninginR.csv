Marcel Steiner-Curtis,"Very good tutorial! Thanks a lot.
If you normalise the data would it not be better to normalise the trainingset and the testset individually?
Otherwise (I  belive) you mix information from the whole dataset which contains the testset into the trainingset.
What is a comon practice?
