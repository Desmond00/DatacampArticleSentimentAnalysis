Dhruv Upadhyay,"Great Article! This was a really comprehensive, detailed, and helpful tutorial, especially as an introduction to machine learning. I was wondering, when choosing the k-value for optimization, why did you not use k=9? Based on my graph, k=9 seems to exhibit most accurate results, and when I run the algorithm with k=9 upon the test-set, it exhibits 100% accuracy. Is it because both test_accuracy=training_accuracy when k=3?",2,24/03/2019 06:13 AM
