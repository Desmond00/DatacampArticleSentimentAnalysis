Osamah Taha,Great tutorial!  Is there any guide that inform you how to select the best algorithm for your problem. as you mentioned earlier Naive Bayes can perform better than XGBoost in some scenario. ,1,24/07/2018 04:25 AM

Vratislav Havlík,"I read a lot about splitting data into train, test and validation split (60:20:20). Why do you estimate here with k-fold cross validation on the whole data and why don't you just estimate it on training data? I thought that first, you  should estimate it on training data, then check results and calibrate on validating data and this all try on testing data.... Thank you for your answer",1,24/09/2018 02:14 PM

Jarvis Nederlof,When you switched back and forth between the sklearn API wrapper and the normal API it became confusing as there was no mention of it. Other than that good tutorial for a beginner.,1,09/01/2019 04:16 AM
