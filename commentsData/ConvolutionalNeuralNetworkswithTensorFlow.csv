Abraham Opanfo Abbam,"Hi, i'm new to cnn and i'm following your tutorials but i'm having some challenges. First, I've successfully loaded the fashion-mnist-dataset but i can't display the images like you have. By the way, i'm using a CPU and not a GPU. I will be very glad to be assisted.

Sandeep Pandey,"Hello,

Thanks for the nicely written tutorial.  I want to request you to put up a tutorial on writing  a custom layer in tensorflow  with trainable weights. The layer takes 2D/3D tensors as input, perform some operations and gives 2D/3D tensor as output. Thanks in advance.",1,20/12/2018 02:22 PM
