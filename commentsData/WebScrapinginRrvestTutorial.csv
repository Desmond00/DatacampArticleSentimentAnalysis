G M,A great way to get the CSS class selectors (tags in the above example) would be to use a selector gadget - it's an easier way for beginners to quickly identify the tags they need. More info can be found here: http://selectorgadget.com ,3,29/04/2018 06:48 AM

Paola Prieto,"Hi, thank you for this exercise. I worked with the copy from your github, and found out that the ratings were not being captured. Then I checked the page and they change the ""count"" for ""star-rating""",3,18/07/2018 07:20 AM
bradley phillips,"I think you need to change the line ""pattern = 'count-'%R% capture(DIGIT)"" on line 74 on github to pattern = 'star-rating-'%R% capture(DIGIT) as the source code appears to have changed. this grabs 2 extra elements to the start on the vector I just removed with vector <- tail(vector,-2). Perhaps you have a neater way to fix this?",1,19/07/2018 03:05 AM
Heber Nielsen,I am struggling with learning the basic setup for parsing the material I scrape and formatting it into a tibble. I hoped this tutorial would help in that. After entering all the functions and confirming that they work (individually) I run into an error message that I cannot debug when I try to run the full material:,1,24/07/2018 02:47 AM

jtariku,I am new to R but was able to scrape names for my research following rvest tutorials but was unable to figure out how to scrape images. Is it possible to scrape images using R at all?

Edgar John,"In step 1 after you wrote the first function of code, you didn't say how to RUN THE CODE and as.numeric() didn't work at first. I added an arg, pages_data and at least the error was gone but I still haven't been ale to get past this. Is this tutorial not designed for beginner/intermediate r users?",1,25/11/2018 09:24 PM
