Chris Leisner,"Suppose that, in the K-means algorithm, you want to use a distance measurement other than Euclidean distance. For example, you might want to use a distance measure that takes into account the curvature of the earth, rather than a distance measure that is only accurate for points in a plane.  Is there any way to run K-means with a different distance measure?",0,24/07/2018 02:26 AM
