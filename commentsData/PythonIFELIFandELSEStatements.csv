JD Torres,"Thank you for breaking this down... when I've tried to learn the if, elif, else statements I've always struggled.  Now that I am trying to teach my 8 year old how to code I am finding that I need to understand it so that I can speak child + code to him so he can get it. ",1,18/08/2018 10:08 AM

pragya pragya,"     I   appreciate that you produced this wonderful article to help us get more   knowledge about this topic. I know, it is not an easy task to write such a   big article in one day, I've tried that and I've failed. But, here you are,   trying the big task and finishing it off and getting good comments and   ratings. That is one hell of a job done!    ",1,29/09/2018 01:11 PM
