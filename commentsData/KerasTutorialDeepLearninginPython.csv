Adrian Gralak,"Hey Karlijn, great tutorial! Had one question though, I'm really confused on why you would want to use k-fold Cross Validation.  Why are we taking the average of the different models - as far as I see these models are working completely independently of each other. Are we meant to average the weights of the individual models to get a better result? Thanks in advance, Adrian.",2,12/02/2018 11:15 PM

David Bloom,"Thanks for the tutorial! Really nice walk through. However, one bit of intuition I'm missing is how to choose the number of hidden units. In the first model, the input layer had a size of 12 and the second layer had 8 hidden units. The second model had 64 and you suggest increasing it to 128 as a possible way to improve the model. Do they need to be multiples of 8? I don't see any other connection. Any guidance would be great. Thanks!",3,10/06/2018 10:50 AM
Sanjay Arumugam Jaganmohan,"There's a typo. Here the model takes in input of (11,) in the first dense layer, not (12,) like mentioned in the paragraph. ",4,11/06/2018 09:46 PM
