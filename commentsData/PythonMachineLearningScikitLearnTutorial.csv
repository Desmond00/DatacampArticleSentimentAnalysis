Isaac Benchetrit," As your use case was one for clustering, you can follow the path on the map towards “KMeans”. You’ll see the use case that you have just thought about requires you to have more than 50 samples (“check!”), to have labeled data (“check!”), to know the number of categories that you want to predict (“check!”) and to have less than 10K samples (“check!”). ",4,22/04/2018 03:16 PM
Isaac Benchetrit," You’ll see that the training set X_train now contains 1347 samples, which is exactly 2/3d of the samples that the original data set contained, and 64 features, which hasn’t changed. The y_traintraining set also contains 2/3d of the labels of the original data set. This means that the test sets X_test and y_test contain 450 samples. ",5,22/04/2018 04:24 PM

Sanjay Sane,Very Nicely explained steps,1,30/07/2018 11:11 PM
Jonathan Kaija,I think the train test split you used is 3/4 and I/4 respectively since test_size = 0.25.,1,12/08/2018 01:20 PM
