Crespin allan,"Hello, thank you for the article, there is one point i don't get, when you aggregate the frequency, you use len() returning the size of the list of InvoiceNo right ? The frequency being the total of invoice if i read your post correctly, you should end up with a round number then ? I may have missed something but i can't find what.
