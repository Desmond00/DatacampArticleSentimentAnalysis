John Davis,"Two questions.  1. How do we tag a tutorial for future reference?  ie. in our datacamp accoount is there anyway to save this particular tutorial?  2. How to add a package to a google cloud datalabvm?  I'm asking this because tensorflow has ffmpeg support if the underlying binary is installed on the vm.  I've found notes about how to use apt inside of a datalab cell and it has supposedly installed ffmpeg, but when I ssh to the instance I do not find ffmpeg in my path.",1,09/07/2018 06:47 PM
