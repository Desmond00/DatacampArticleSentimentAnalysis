Abhi Rajan,"Thanks for the article. I typically write functions and leave things at that. This article was really helpful. I had one question, in the MovingAverage class, when initializing stuff, why choose to init both symbol and bars (also why the variable name ""bars""?). As far as I can make out, only bars is necessary to run the method.

Also I think you want to pass bars to the generate_signals method - def generate_signals(self, bars)",1,03/04/2018 09:54 PM
