Wesley Duckett,"In the section where you first describe support, confidence, lift, etc., shouldn't the probability notation be using the symbol for intersection, P(A ∩ B ), rather than union, P(A ∪ B), since we want the probably that both A and B are bought together? A union would calculate the probability that either A or B were bought individually regardless of if the other product was bought. In the case of bread => milk, the union would result in 100% support, not 60%. Please correct me if I am missing something. Otherwise, thank you for the very detailed article, very helpful!",4,28/11/2018 03:53 AM
