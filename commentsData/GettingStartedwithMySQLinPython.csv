,"This tutorial is well-written. However,  I feel Oracle's MySQL tutorial seems better. One thing is that these examples does not show that you need to close the cursor and disconnect the connection. Beginners usually try out examples verbatim,  so these examples would cause one to open multiple connections to the database. Also the data fetched from the database could be large, so using fetchall() before iteration over the elements in the results seems inefficient and not idiomatic at least.",1,08/06/2019 07:19 AM
