Anubhav Tiwari,"Why not build basic models using other features like its done with the survived column  spit over the gender column( i.e . all the women survived and men didn't ) . Maybe other features would give better accuracy before starting with machine learning . for example : PC class shows that passengers who traveled in first class were more likely to survive so we could build a model that all 1st class passengers survived and  rest didn't , similarly with other features .",1,02/06/2018 04:39 PM
