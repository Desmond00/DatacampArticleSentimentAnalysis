Gabriel Mocan,Do you think that is possible to apply these techniques to Forex market? Feeding the system with real time data from let's say five minutes candles from the last month or so trying to predict the direction of the market for the next hours or so...

Joe Damuth,As someone who has been developing for a few years but is pretty new to python I've found this work to be very insightful and well explained! Oddly enough the only thing I can't figure out is how to read the graph at the very end.  Would you be able to explain what the lines creating the graph are doing?  ,1,11/08/2018 09:08 PM

Wang Yi,"Hey I have to make a comment here: your explanation after LSTM section is kinda a mess and I don't think people can follow you and your code (as complained by others in the comment section). And I found the reference repository you listed did a way better job explaining the process and the result! Even the code using Keras is way simpler and easier to follow. I don't know what you're trying to say about the final visualization, did you even describe what the graph is?",2,27/08/2018 12:00 PM

Lyn Cheese,"Hi Sir !
Thank you for your tutorial

I have some doubt that maybe you can clear out.

Firstly, after I read your explanation, I though the code will predict the 50 steps ahead of time.
But, I think your code is in the end just predicting a one step-ahead.

Your num_unrolling is how many steps back you run to get info from training data, to predict the one step ahead thing.
From there you run prediction to the future for n_predict_once times.
At this point, maybe this is what you mean by predicting 50 steps ahead, because n_predict_once is 50
But, if it work that way, then your prediction is hardly to even reach 50% accuracy.
Since we predict n_predict_once ahead, then I should observe only the tail from the red line, which is the 50th prediction ahead.
This value is in the end the 50th steps ahead prediction which we want.

So, if we compare the tail of each red line with the real price movement.
There are many times, where the red tail is going down while the price movement is up, and so the opposite.

In short, I wonder, what exactly you mean by ""able to predict stock price behavior correctly most of the time"" ?
Because it was not so.
Am I missing something ?
