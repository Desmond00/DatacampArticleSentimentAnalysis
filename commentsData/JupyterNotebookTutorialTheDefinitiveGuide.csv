Jon Brown,This was great.  Although I had a look at Jupyter dashboards as mentioned but it doesn't seem to be actively developed and the existing version doesn't seem to support packaging - have you managed to use this package to share a dashboard?  The only thing I could manage to do with the package was to use the dashboard previewer.,1,17/06/2018 03:16 AM

Benjamin B,For a better workflow I always recommend the nbextensions. Especially the Table of content is useful for a better overview and the possibility to jump between the chapters. Also the Variable explorer is useful!,1,18/10/2018 05:16 PM

Wesley Shen,"Hi there, thanks so much for this tutorial. I've been wanting to practice using Docker to make sure my projects are reproducible. This tutorial was helpful in showing me how to start a Jupyter Notebook using Docker. But how do I then make sure that I containerize all the dependencies that my notebook requires to run the project? I guess just trying to figure out what is the benefit of running notebooks using Docker and what do I do once I finish the notebook? Thank you so much.",1,19/01/2019 07:39 AM
