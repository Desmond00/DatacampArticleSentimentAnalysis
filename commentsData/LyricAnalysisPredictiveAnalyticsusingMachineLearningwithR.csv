Balary Nash,"Wonderful! Thank you very much! But, when running the code ""train <- features_func_genre(five_sources_tidy)"", I got the error ""Evaluation error: invalid multibyte string, element 1."" and don't know why. Would you get what happened?",3,12/01/2019 12:57 PM
Todd Scott,I would like to see if you analize chords to see if you can predict genr.,2,15/01/2019 10:07 PM

Mark McNall,"Thanks for all your posts in this series Debbie, it's been some really interesting material and tutorials to go through. I had a quick question for you going back to Part 1. I'm a Masters student in the field and due to my love of music I'm considering doing my final capstone project on the evolution of Pop music through the decades using a lot of techniques I've learned in your tutorials. However, building the dataset of songs and lyrics through web scraping and cleaning isn't something I'm familiar with. Is this any chance you'd be able to share your code and/or workflow on how you created the original dataset so I could learn from that?",3,17/01/2019 12:38 AM

Arun Mahendrakar,"One of the best in-depth tutorial I've followed through in a while. I've been learning about Machine Learning and R for a few months now, but articles like yours make me realize how much more there is for me to know, also builds more respect for all you data scientists. Big thanks to you Debbie. ",2,27/05/2019 09:15 PM
