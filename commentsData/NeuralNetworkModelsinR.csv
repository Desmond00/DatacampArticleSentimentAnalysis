Holger von Jouanne-Diedrich,Thank you for this article... as it happened I also just posted an article which gives a lot of intuition how Neural Networks work: http://blog.ephorie.de/understanding-the-magic-of-neural-networks - hope that helps!,3,22/01/2019 09:21 PM

Debasish Saha,"Thanks for such a comprehensive tutorial, especially useful for beginners in ANN like me. I am also interested in learning how to implement NN for multiple vector outputs. In my discipline we deal with multiple natural processes (vector outputs) that are influenced by same set of input variables (such as weather parameters). Having a multi-output NN architecture would facilitate inter-connections between a same input variable influencing differently (+ or -) two different processes. Any further help in terms implementing in code would be appreciate. Thanks.",2,03/04/2019 09:19 PM
