David Galli," State machines are the basics of computer science. It's kind of funny to suggest this as an extra reading material... on the other hand, it's also funny to think that they are a good way to deal with decision trees. Since, if you ever took an uk essay writing automata class, you'd know that state machines are limited in that they don't have any ""memory"", which means that you can only describe regular languages using this formalism.  ",1,07/05/2019 03:19 PM
