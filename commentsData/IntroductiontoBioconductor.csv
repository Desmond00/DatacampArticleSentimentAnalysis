Shon Inouye,"It is important to note that the installation shown in this tutorial is for older versions of Bioconductor. The new installation process can be found on the Bioconductor website. If you'd like to learn more about the package and its use, definitely check out ""Introduction to Bioconductor"" and all of the other Bioconductor courses on DataCamp!",1,15/03/2019 07:41 PM
