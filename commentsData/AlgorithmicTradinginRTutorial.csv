Massimo Trolis,"I agree with Dipanjan, I was replicating the code in order to train and improve coding, but it stops at read.html, failing connection since the website doesn't exist anymore. It would be great to apply with another site, I will use this tutorial as a theoretical training, since it really usefull and well described. Greetings from Italy",1,22/08/2018 11:24 AM
