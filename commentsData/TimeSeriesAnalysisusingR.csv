NASEER MOHAMMED,"This article has projected the Time series analysis in very complex way & it is only understandable by Data scientist who have some hands-on experience. Time-Series could have been easily explained i.e converting Non-stationary time series data set to stationary by using differencing concept, and then how ACF & PACF plot can be used for passing into ARIMA, to get relevant forecast.",8,23/10/2018 07:56 PM

Mikhail Sidyakov,I believe the ACF where the formula: gamma(k)/gamma(0) is presented is the Autocorrelation function not Autocovariance function.,1,30/05/2019 07:23 AM
