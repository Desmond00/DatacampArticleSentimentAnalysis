Al C,"Love that the intro of this story is about how in the workplace, you are forced to use Excel even though you would like to use all the fancy new data science tools. I've been using Excel for 10+ years and believe that more Excel people are moving to data science, programming, etc. since they realize that Excel and spreadsheets will eventually go away to be replaced by more modern tools like Coda (disclosure: I work there).",1,20/03/2019 01:57 AM
