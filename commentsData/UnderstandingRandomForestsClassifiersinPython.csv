Nehmy FORBIN,"Hello Avinash,
First of all : thank you for this tutorial very accurate and receptive!
Then, I have a question : once you have got the feature importances, it could good to know in which way those features affect the target.
To be more clear a little ex : ""more the petal with is great, more the iris could be a setosa"".

Do you think, it's relevant to use a linear model (ex : logistic regression) to define that?

raj kumar,I need to build a model to find credit risk of a customer. My dataset contains 1000 rows out of which only 30 rows are having credit risk as 0 while other 970 has value as 1.
