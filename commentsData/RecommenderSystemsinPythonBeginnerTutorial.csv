Abbas Zahid,"I am not able to get pass through
tfidf_matrix.shape
out[] : (45466, 75827)
cosine_sim = cosine_similarity(tfidf_matrix,tfidf_matrix)
This cosine_sim give me an error:  array is too big; `arr.size * arr.dtype.itemsize` is larger than the maximum possible size.
Any idea whats wrong with this ?",2,21/03/2018 07:08 PM
