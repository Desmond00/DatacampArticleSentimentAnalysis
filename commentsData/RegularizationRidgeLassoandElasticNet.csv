Ningxin Wang,"Thanks so much for this article! it‘s very helpful. I need to test regression suitability for my data, and my teammates suggests me read about elastic net techniques. Your article clearly explains why these methods are helpful in analyzing large predictor data. I’ll try to test these methods using python. ",3,11/01/2019 11:29 PM
