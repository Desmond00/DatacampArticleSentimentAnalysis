nicegreatest7asan,"there is a mix up when explaining np.linspace() and np.arange(), np.linspace takes number of samples and np.arange() takes the step value",7,04/03/2018 04:49 PM
Joshua Brengel,"Nice tutorial.  In the ""How NumPy Broadcasting Works"" section, when talking about array ""x"" having dimensions 3x4 and ""y"" dimensions 5x1x4, is that not the shape of the arrays as opposed to the dimensions?  x.ndim gives me 2 and y.ndim gives me 3.  I'm trying to learn more about arrays and I was a bit confused by this.  Are shape and dimension sometimes used interchangeably?   Does this mean that if any of the arrays being broadcasted has a 1 in its shape (as opposed to dimension), it is possible to broadcast without an error?  Thanks!",2,09/05/2018 12:42 AM
Gabriel Shih,"The comments on np.hsplit and np.vsplit are not very correct. As the second arguments are 2, my_stacked_array will be split into two sections of equal sizes. It will be split at the 2nd index if the second argument is [2].",3,04/09/2018 12:44 PM

Haris Riaz,"There is a bit of correction to be made in this tutorial in the part regarding splitting of arrays. In both  np.hsplit() and np.vsplit(), the second argument is in fact not the index at which to split the array, but rather the equal number of parts in which the array must be split. This means we can't just supply any arbitrary number as the second argument...it depends upon the shape of our array. In this case my_stacked_array has shape (2,8) which means it can be split horizontally into two arrays of equal shape (2,4) each or it can be split vertically into two arrays of equal shape (1,8) each. This wasn't explained in the tutorial and I felt it important to highlight.",2,08/01/2019 06:15 AM
Mohammed Innat,Awesome overview on NumPy. Someone may also find this repository useful too for NumPy. ,1,20/03/2019 02:29 AM
Python Examples Org,"Numpy is the most basic package one has to master. Be it image processing, deep-learning or solving any mathematical  problem. And the Python Examples provided here are very good to learn Python Numpy. Thanks for this detailed examples.",1,15/05/2019 10:46 AM
Grant Wilson,Thanks for the comprehensive and highly informative tutorial. NumPy is a must have for any scientific project.  We used it for Machine Learning with Python: from Linear Models to Deep Learning (projects by post graduates at Massachusetts Institute of Technology).
