David Richter,"Many thanks for your work. The best approach for the beginner is to understand that statistical methods performed on data will   not only reveal quirky data  that should be overlooked, but also data needed to construct the model.  The model can reveal further insight into the analysis  that will solve a problem and also lead to another form of model that helps the data scientist get further insight. When the predictions  become accurate a significant amount of the time, then the frequency of the data reveal in some histogram will establish a solid evaluative feedback. That feedback can be the baseline for future data analysis on similar data-frames. The sum of the parts could be greater than the whole, but the model derived from the statistics turns clusters into informative graphical charts. ",1,15/05/2018 12:02 PM
Chunji Wang,"Are you sure `fustat` means ""censored or not""? If so, then it is the opposite of ""event"". But when you call `Surv()` you have `event = ovarian.fustat`; shouldn't it be `event = 1 - ovarian.fustat` ? (I cannot type `$` here so I replaced it with `.`)",3,17/05/2018 01:14 AM
Matt Hanauer,Thanks for the post!! I think there might be an error in the comment starting with Examine.  I think you meant predictive instead of prdictive. ,2,22/05/2018 02:17 AM

Efe Ogolo,"First, this is a very well done walk through of survival analysis. I have a question regarding prediction. Is it possible to use survival analysis methods to predict the likelihood of an event happening for new data that wasn't used to construct the original KM curve or Proportional Hazard model?",4,13/08/2018 09:40 PM
Norberto Vera Reatiga,"Muchas gracias, excelente tutorial.",2,29/08/2018 05:41 AM

Michael Jarmola,Why do you dichotomize the age variable into age_group? Could continuous variables be included for Cox Proportional Hazard models?,2,13/09/2018 05:08 AM
gilles marteau,"Hi, great stuff ! Very clear, instructive, and efficient.
One remark though : I ve been curious about the time unit of the futime variable... and none of you guys talk about it ! Even the help('ovarian') doesn't precise what this variable is counting.
Ooops ?

I assumed it is a count of days and it may be obvious for survival pros, but pros or not, any graph or table HAS TO GIVE NUMBERS AND THEIR UNITS ;)",3,19/10/2018 01:51 PM

Albert Isaacs,"Thank you so much for this. You've saved me a lot! For some reason, I am unable to have my covariates separated out into groups like yours. e.g. yours nicely dichotomizes each covariate (rx into A and B, resin.ds into A and B etc.). Mine is unable to recognize the dichotomy in each covariate (although they have been assigned in the spreadsheet data I am using).  This is an example of my code if that helps:",1,05/05/2019 08:31 AM
