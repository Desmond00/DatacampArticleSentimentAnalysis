Moyosoreoluwa Akala,"Hello Sayak, if your app is built with java for instance, and you have built your python api with flask due for integration.

Deepan Sanghavi,"Hello,

It is a good solution if someone can afford to put python environment to run on the server or in the application. But the application that i am working on,  I cannot create a python environment to run a flask application. Though I have java environment setup. Can I do similar thing that you showed with flask, with java as well? If yes, then I can just make a Java API where I can load the model and then I don't have to create a python environment. thanks in advance",1,04/04/2019 10:12 PM

Zayyed M,"Hi Sayak, I really appreciate this tutorial - very easy to follow, but I have a quick question. When I run the model,  its seems as though all of the females ""survive"" and none of the men ""survive"", regardless of the other passenger features such as Age? Even a 1 year old male returns a ""0"".  Do you know where the problem could be? I basically copied and pasted your code.",1,10/06/2019 09:54 PM
