i883736,"For anyone struggeling with the unnest function, getting the error, Input must be a character vector of any length or a list of character
 vectors, each of which has a length of 1., if you have closed you workspace, you need to once again declare stringsAsFactors = FALSE when reading in your csv, this is not automatically written to the newly saved csv",1,30/05/2018 04:01 AM
i883736,"Just a note on the use of TF-IDF here. This method is useful to distinguish how important a word is to a document (song in this  case) in relation to the corpus. Using it like here tells us very little, except for that there is a single song that uses purple a lot, or a single song that uses hide a lot",1,31/05/2018 02:01 AM

Phillip Hayes,"Great idea for app! I'm a junior Java developer and my huge challenge to myself in the field of development is just the creation of a program of learning to play the guitar, but not like not one. The advantage is that I myself am a beginner guitarist and just bought the best capo for acoustic guitar and the latest model of acoustic guitar for self-study. I believe that the process of self-education and the development of simultaneous software itself will provide a huge return on the development of a modern game for all who want to learn how to play the instrument.",2,01/05/2019 02:07 PM
