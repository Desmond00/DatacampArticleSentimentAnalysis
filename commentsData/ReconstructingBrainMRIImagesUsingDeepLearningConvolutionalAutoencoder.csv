Brian Droncheff,"Really, a huge thanks for making this tutorial.

I did notice that when it is said ""It's time to check the shape of the numpy array, the first dimension of the array should be 207 x 30 = 6210 respectively and the remaining two dimensions will be 173 x 173. ""  it should be:  ""...  51 x 30 = 1530 respectively and the remaining two dimensions will be 173 x 173"". Just in case anyone gets confused. Note above only 51 of the 207 slices were taken.",3,22/04/2019 02:45 AM
