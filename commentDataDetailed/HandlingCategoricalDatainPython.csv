Michal Lasak,"I believe there's an error in the one-hot encoding/ LabelBinarizer part:  it should be lb_results_df = pd.DataFrame(lb_results, columns=lb.classes_) , as lb_style is not defined anywhere before.

Apart from that, great tutorial!",2,24/05/2018 08:50 PM
Joe Bloggs,Some discussion  of categorical embedding using neural networks would help round out the picture.  This was applied successfully in a third place solution to the Rossmann stores competition.  Seems like a great alternative to one-hot with the added benefit of dimensionality reduction.,1,28/05/2018 03:25 PM
Sheshenderr Goswami,"Hi 

I'm getting a value error:  fill value must be in categories. When i use binary encoding. The column to be coded has no missing values.",1,21/06/2018 12:41 PM
Heba Mazhar,"Could someone help me with downloading categorical_encoders??
When I use pip install categorical_encoders -- I get this error message  ""error: Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 is required. Get it with ""Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools"": http://landinghub.visualstudio.com/visual-cpp-build-tools""

And when I download and unzip the file, and run my code it says failed to import library ""categorical_encoders""
Please help !!!",1,09/08/2018 07:41 PM
Matthew Walker,"So, once you have your categorical data encoded, what next?  What about these questions:

inferential statistics can then be performed?  

Can those features now be treated as continuous datatypes?  Or, do  they still get treated differently, with different statistics applied to them?

Do their dtypes need to be changed (or are automatically changed) to int/float dtypes?  ",1,20/09/2018 09:40 PM

Özkan Akyüz,"hello, very useful article

I have a got a problem with the dataset I am working on a capstone project. I got a dataframe which has the following shape  

(1006090, 79)

Can I use a encoding machanism which don't results in many columns. For a much smaller subset (about 2500 rows x 79 columns), I used pandas get_dummies() function, and this resulted in about 12000 news columsn. 

Also, I want to apply ML algorithms like decision trees and logistic regression. Is it possible to encode my feature set X without specifying which columns to be encoded? What is the best way to avoid adding many new columns like (one-hot-encoding), but still keeping the advantage of not weighing the categorical features (like LabelEncoding)? 

I am looking forward for guidance. ",3,01/01/2019 11:22 AM
Karishma Saikia,This is so great!! i was struggling so hard dealing with categorical values for my model. Thanks a ton!!,1,26/03/2019 10:41 PM
Tharika Weerakoon,"Hi great guide for categorical data handling. I am wondering whether we can re-convert those encoded categorical data back to original format for the purpose of final result presentation after training the model. 

I am a newbie and I can't find a way to have a meaningful representation. Here I have used Binary Encoding. 

Looking for a great insight.",1,30/04/2019 03:28 PM
Anuka Pradhan,"since in my dataset there are categorical fearures that is project type and the type are (A, P, C, Pr....) but in this column there is the symbol like ? so how would i know which type is this or how can i replace this using python program?",1,01/05/2019 04:41 PM

I had a question. Why in binary encoder we have only for type of carrier ???",1,06/06/2019 03:18 PM
