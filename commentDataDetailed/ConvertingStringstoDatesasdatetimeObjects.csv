Max Carey,"I'm working with a dataset where the format of dates is `2015-09-04T00:00:00`

But I can't figure out the directives to parse it.

From the research I've done: You think it would be '%Y-%m-%d%%T%X'

The double percent would mean a literal 'T' character.

Thanks for your help",5,11/08/2018 07:39 AM
