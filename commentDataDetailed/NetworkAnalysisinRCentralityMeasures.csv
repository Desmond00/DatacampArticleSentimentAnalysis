J C,"In your example, does the PCA really mean that Barycenter Centrality can determine the central nodes more accurately than the chosen centrality? Doesn't it just mean that it has the strongest correlation with the other centrality measures you chose to include?",3,25/11/2018 12:12 PM
Bi Zhao,"Hi Minoo,

Thanks for the tutorial. I tried the PCA method according to your code on my network, which was generated using ""igraph"". But the line ""calculate_centralities(zachary, include = pr_cent[1:5])%>%  pca_centralities(scale.unit = TRUE)"" returns error message that ""the input is not an igraph object"". I replaced Zachary with my own network data. And I checked with ""is.igraph"" for my network, it returns ""TRUE"". I wonder if you might be able to help me figure out what went wrong?",1,06/02/2019 08:32 PM
