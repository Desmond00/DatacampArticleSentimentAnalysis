Charlotte Skelton,thanks man it was very informative for me. I have been working on Knime for a while now. And this tutorial really helped me a lot with R. The learning curve is there but its not super hard. I have recently started working on Machine Learning so its really exciting for me to get into all these  different softwares.. I recently worked on a Data set of Canada Skilled Worker Application and i made a mess.  But now its ok and i am doing pretty good now.,2,23/11/2018 06:12 PM
