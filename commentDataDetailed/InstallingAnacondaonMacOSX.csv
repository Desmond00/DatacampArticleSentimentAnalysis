Hari Santanam,"Anaconda Navigator UI for Mac is great, you can access Jupyter notebook, spyder (Python IDE) and other tools from there. The challenge is to install some libraries which can be tricky, as mentioned in the article.  Installing tensor flow environment was challenging as well (or perhaps my lack of knowledge was the problem!).",1,12/06/2018 09:47 PM

Kostya Malikov,"great article! The only thing I've faced to is fixing python PATH:

python --version // showed error cant find python in 2.7 library.

 I've fixed it in Anaconda Navigator -> Spyder -> in application click on ""python"" in the header and setup your PYTHONPATH

Felipe Echeverria,"Thank you so much,  your tutoría has been very useful. I've been trying to instala an MGTools pkg with conde comand, but it launches the following error:

Traceback (most recent call last):
File ""/Users/feli/anaconda2/bin/conda"", line 12, in <module>
from conda.cli import main
ImportError: No module named conda.cli

I've tried many options to solve this problem, including adding the path on the .bash_profile (export PATH=""/Users/feli/anaconda2/bin:$PATH""), but nothing seems to solve it. Do you know more about this error? Thanks!! ",0,05/02/2019 01:27 AM
