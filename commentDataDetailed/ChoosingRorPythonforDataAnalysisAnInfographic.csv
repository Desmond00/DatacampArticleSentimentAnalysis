Robert Brown,"Thanks for sharing.  Does portability matter at all?  Some Mac data scientists are restricted to the distro of python and must manually install the required packages into an existing framework, as opposed to being restricted entirely from utilizing R.",1,01/07/2018 07:00 AM

Mark Jones,"Great infographics, thanks :) Is there an up to date version (as this originates from 2015)?

For example, as  I type,  the current version of R is now 3.5.1 (Feather Spray) that was released in July 2018, and Python is 3.7.1 released just a few days ago on 20th October 2018.  The Python section also talks about iPython Notebooks, which have been superseded by Jupyter Notebooks, and laterly JupyterLab.  

Not a huge issue, just wondering if it has been, or is planned to be, updated.  Thanks Mark",2,24/10/2018 04:24 PM

Dhanush Yuvaraja,"Hi,

For an MBA graduate, i guess i can take it from the article that most of the time we are exposed to work on data and get informations from it.

and i guess for our routine data analysis R is preferred compared to Python which is quite advance and usefull in production environment.

Any comments on it from perspective for a business grad ",1,17/12/2018 10:15 PM

Steven Sarasin,"A great idea for an article, and it looks pretty but definitely bring your salt grains with you while reading this.

From the summary: ""Any piece of functionality is always written the same way in Python."" - This is an obviously false statement. Come on now. It's a programming language. 

I feel like there should be a theorem ""Any sufficiently nontrivial programming language has two different ways to achieve the same effect."" ",1,11/05/2019 05:39 AM
Terry Shaw,"Very detailed and practical analysis. R stylesheets are more usable than I thought and never used to use it as often as I should have.  It is encouraging to see R finding a solid foothold in the enterprise market.
