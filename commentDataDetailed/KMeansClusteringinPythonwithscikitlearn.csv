Mustafa Ghafouri,The best practice is to impute missing values in the test set using mean/median of the train set.,2,25/10/2018 09:02 PM

After calculate KMeans values, how can we link to obj column so that to know which obj belongs to which cluster?",3,13/12/2018 01:37 PM

How can I do that?",1,28/04/2019 11:17 PM
Rishika Malik,"but how do i know which person has been classified correctly? can i export the result to excel?

also,  here we know the the basis of clustering is survival or death. but in a case where we don't know the basis of the cluster, just this analysis wont solve the problem. we will then have to analyse why each case was put into a particular cluster",1,30/05/2019 03:11 PM
