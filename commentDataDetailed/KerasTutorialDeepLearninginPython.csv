Adrian Gralak,"Hey Karlijn, great tutorial! Had one question though, I'm really confused on why you would want to use k-fold Cross Validation.  Why are we taking the average of the different models - as far as I see these models are working completely independently of each other. Are we meant to average the weights of the individual models to get a better result? Thanks in advance, Adrian.",2,12/02/2018 11:15 PM

zhuowang,"Really awesome program. But I face a problem when run line

""y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

y_pred[:5]""

I got the results of  continuous number and the data type is float32. Where should I modify to change the data type to int? Thank you",3,29/05/2018 11:14 PM
David Bloom,"Thanks for the tutorial! Really nice walk through. However, one bit of intuition I'm missing is how to choose the number of hidden units. In the first model, the input layer had a size of 12 and the second layer had 8 hidden units. The second model had 64 and you suggest increasing it to 128 as a possible way to improve the model. Do they need to be multiples of 8? I don't see any other connection. Any guidance would be great. Thanks!",3,10/06/2018 10:50 AM
Sanjay Arumugam Jaganmohan,"There's a typo. Here the model takes in input of (11,) in the first dense layer, not (12,) like mentioned in the paragraph. ",4,11/06/2018 09:46 PM

rutgerquee,"Hello Karlijn,
 

A great tutorial!
When importing the confusion matrix I get the following error message:
ValueError: Rating statistics can not handle a mix of binary and continuous targets.
I have searched google for a solution but I can not find one.
can you tell me what I'm doing wrong?

I hope to hear from you, thanks in advance!

Kind regards,

Nicola Masarone,"Hi Karlijn,

great tutorial !

By the way, it seems there is a typo in the code to plot the correlation matrix: sns.plt.show() doesn't work while plt.show() works well.

Don Lee,"Karlijn, thank you very much for your sharing this great tutorial, I have two questions, could you please help?

1: It seems to me that I don't need call np.ravel for y value when fitting the second Regression model, which is definitely needed for the first Classification model, any explanation why?

2: it seems that the ""for loop"" for  kfold.split() , doesn't build/accumulate up the training knowledge, as model is created within each loop, is this understanding right? then how to fix? 

Thanks in advance for your explanation. ",2,28/11/2018 10:19 PM

Alexander Baker,"Great tutorial, I've read through tons, and this is by far the best one I've seen yet.  I actually have it bookmarked. 

I do have one question:

The algorithm you presented outputs probabilities, do we just code them to 1's and 0's ourselves or is there a step I missed?",1,03/01/2019 07:41 AM
Raghava Reddy,"y_pred array in confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred) expecting 0s or 1s.  So I used   y_pred = y_pred >= 0.13 to make 0s or 1s. But confusion matrix  gave the result   array([[1564,   24],

      [  27,  530]])




But as per your tutorial array([[1585,    3],

      [   8,  549]])

could please explain

may i know how to convert speech dataset to .csv files.

i am working in speech emotion recognition . i had the dataset of .wav type.

can i load the .wav files directly using Keras...
