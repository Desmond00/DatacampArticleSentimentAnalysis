Hi, Avinash, many thanks for your contribution via this article, it helps me a lot, truth is. I have some doubts, pls:

a. you mentioned that the input data needs to be numerical. However I am seeing that the target one was also converted via label encoding. Is that mandatory hence? 

b. does LabelEncoding works alphabetically while assigning 0, 1, 2s etc? 

c. “Let's split dataset by using function train_test_split()Additionally, you can use random_state to select records randomly.”: shouldn’t we FIRST random data and afterwards split it so that we make sure we avoid data manipulation? 

Thank you in advance!",2,10/09/2018 12:24 AM
