Abdourahamane Sank Bah,"@Hafeezul Kareem Shaik, 

Thanks for the tutorial!!

But there is a lot of typo and mismatching. Indeed sometime you use Statement in lieu of Question.

Please fix it for the new comers, it is great starting point.

Seraphin Vandegar,"Hi ! 


Thank you for this tutorial. I think it would be useful to correct the different typos and mismatch as it's really hard to follow by a newbie. 

Beside of this I'm stuck at two points : 

I cannot figure out where you define Question.objects method. My IDE is raising an error when I write it in views.py, in the index definition>
Same question for Choice.DoesNotExists in the vote definition. 

I assume it should be defined in models.py but I can't find any explanation of this.

Could you please help me ?

Darrell Hall,"Hello:

Thanks for this tutorial.  I can read and follow it better than the tutorial on the Django site.  The screen shots help quite a bit.  However, on the Django web  site and in this tutorial , we're asked to create a URLConf file called ""urls.py"".    But my reactions were the same each time, ""...HOW?"", And where in the instructions preceding this task is creating this file in  this directory, explained?"".  I'm  thinking that this is a simple task to code, but somehow I missed it in both tutorials.  Could you point me in the right direction please?  Thanks.",1,06/10/2018 11:52 PM
