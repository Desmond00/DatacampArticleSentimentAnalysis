Alex T,"Hi, great work, great tut. 

I noticed that you have twice the following import:   from nltk.corpus import stopwords 

Is that correct or you just typed it accidentally? ",2,21/07/2018 01:06 AM

Could you please give me some help?

Thank you!",1,24/07/2018 08:53 PM
Morten Bjoernsvik,where is the requirement.txt holding the modules needed and their version. sklearn is now at v0.18 and lots of the imports are deprecated,1,24/07/2018 09:59 PM

Jonathan Mallia,"Do you keep the POS tags when doing TfIDF, for example grant/NN ? 

How does it help the model to use grant/NN instead of just grant?

Thanks",1,28/07/2018 04:10 PM

Bonnie Miller,"Thanks for the helpful hint, this is exactly what I was looking for. Junior similar functionality is still complex. The perfect example for me is https://planetofhotels.com/en/. Excellent usability and clean code, and the functionality itself works very quickly and responsively. Also, functions on the choice of the price of a filter and the type of hotel / room are very interestingly worked",1,10/05/2019 08:30 PM
