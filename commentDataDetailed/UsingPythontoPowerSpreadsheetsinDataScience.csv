Bryant Crocker,Great points raised in this article.  I agree that python is the absolute easiest way to to analyze data. Tableau is good contender that I very rarely hear brought up.  Personally I prefer R for data analysis but python is definitely easier to use than R. ,1,13/06/2018 07:07 AM
Keith Win,I am an Excel power user and learning to code Python on datacamp! I'd love to combine the two!  ,2,13/06/2018 07:12 AM
Avinash Navlani,Awesome tutorial with lots of useful information. Thanks Jason Graham.,2,13/06/2018 12:38 PM
Viraj B,The points have been laid down and explained really well. Kudos!,3,18/06/2018 04:30 PM
Alexandra Ijay Kaz,You have put it together so excellently. I am exploring the abilities of Pandas myself. It has been an amazing journey so far.,4,19/06/2018 08:40 PM
Kendra Frederick,"I need to create and manage data collection & analysis tools that other people use. Given the fact (which you mention in an above comment) that far more people are familiar with Excel than with Python or Jupyter, how would you recommend setting up a workflow? Keep data entry in Excel, but transition analysis, visualization, and reporting to Jupyter? That way, most people don't need to learn a new software, and a few people trained in Python can maintain the analysis side of things. Regardless, this article is certainly an inspiration to improve our workflow, despite currently being so reliant on Excel!!",3,19/06/2018 08:47 PM
Saad Afzal,"This is a very relevant article for me. I fell in love with python language when i was first introduced to it by a collegue and since started using my weekends to learn python, pandas etc here on Datacamp. Im an experienced user of Excel vba and i had some procedures which incoming goal seek and loops set up in Excel vba which i tried to replicate in python but i failed badly. There was no way to create a goal seek procedure in python and after several tries I reverted back to excel. Especially one of the procedures with goal seek was so important for my work so I couldn’t see myself working with python. If i someday meet some skilled python programmer I will ask that person to help me create a goal seek procedure until then I am stuck with excel. :(",0,20/06/2018 01:32 AM
jcchidiadi,Excellent article. I love how pandas reduces the number of lines of code needed to do many things. I love the data visualization aspect and learning everyday to be better at python and pandas.,1,20/06/2018 02:52 AM
rehanster,"There are many points in this article where I perk up, crack a huge smile on my face and then take a deep sigh, because there are so (so so) many things I can relate to. 




I consider myself to be a strong Excel user, and for six years, during the entirety of my post-graduation employment, I have always been required to undertake data activities and present clear management information for key decision making.




I love Excel, as I have already alluded to, I am proficient in it and consider its usage the very fibre of my work. However, I have always longed for something more. 




From the few roles I have had in the past six years, I would deem 90% of my time being taken up in some form of admin. Whether this is bringing together different data sets (exports from: SAP, Oracle/Toad, SQL, and other people’s spreadsheets); bringing consistency; cleaning, centralising, analysing and summarising the data; publishing the management information in an open and transparent manner: all this stuff is repetitive administration. Yes, it requires some brain power, some skill, some persistence (note the overlap of skills required for hacking/coding). But once I’ve cracked it, I am just turning the handle every day.




This knowledge and this feeling has, at times, left me feeling like a fraud. So I started to learn to code in Python.




This has been a colossal struggle for me. I have repeatedly questioned whether I’m cut out for coding, and often evaluated whether I truly need to learn it, because I can just carry on (being a fraud) with my Excel spreadsheets, which most of my customers enjoy.




Q: Why do I struggle with learning Python? A: Mostly, it centres around boredom. 




I use DataCamp and I think it is easily the best means for me to gain knowledge, skills, practice and exposure: I definitely believe my subscription is a worthwhile investment for my future career prospects and don’t question my value for money (I don’t work for DataCamp and am getting no brownie points for saying this – it is my genuine personal view). However, I can sit at my laptop and do exercise after exercise, using DataCamp’s hypothetical scenarios: but after about 20 minutes, the marginal returns diminish to very (very very) little learning. 




Unless I am doing projects that mean something to me, that are actual and not hypothetical, I cannot seem to engage beyond the initial 20 minutes. And this is not a criticism of the course content or structure: I am not saying the activities need to be more engaging. Indeed, many data scientists I have spoken to about this problem, tell me to switch over to Kaggle and do something I am interested in to keep my motivation and engagement. But my problem is fundamentally centred on the sheer lack of basic Python knowledge I currently poses, and my being so very near the beginning of my journey (not in terms of time, but knowledge), that I just need to continue putting in the hours and learning the essential stuff and battle my boredom.




These feelings result in serious fluctuations in my learning curve. I can spend one hour of every day in a week, actively learning. Then I can waste three weeks without touching any material, and eroding the skills of what I should have already committed to memory.




Whenever I evaluate my ambition learn data science, it stems from two angles: 1) the deep fear that my ‘fraud’ will eventually be caught, automated by some data scientist/engineer in a faraway land (where it’s cheaper for my employer to pay for a support service contract than it is to employ and accommodate me); but mostly 2) boredom of ‘turning the handle’.




I repeat for the last time: I love Excel. But I hate the repetitive admin, and when I’m bored, my mind wonders.




I’ve already (roughly) accounted for 90% of my time being taken up in Excel admin. From the remaining 10%: 5% of it is spent in (mostly redundant) meetings and phone calls; 4% of it talking to someone about what the value of my work has been, and how to access and utilise the MI I have published; but only 1% of my time in thinking about business problems and how I can engineer a solution by using the available data.




I feel I need to learn Python to get out of the 1) fear, 2) boredom and 3) redress the aforementioned percentage imbalances and increase productive time where I am thinking and engineering solutions to business problems.




Am I right? Anybody else feel the same?",1,20/06/2018 04:06 PM
Siegfred Balona,"I strongly agree with you on several points. I myself is an advanced Excel user but after spending lots of time with Python and R, I became hooked and switched completely from Excel. Python and R is the absolute go to when it comes to data analysis and data science as a whole.",3,21/06/2018 08:50 PM
David Nealey,"Jason this is an excellent review of Excel and Python.  And thanks for the links to other DataCamp and commercial sites.   

I haven't  used Excel very much since since the 80's.  What is your experience using Access with Python?   I do just about everything in Access including data analysis, custom dataviz, mapping, and text-to-speech.  ",1,29/08/2018 12:43 AM
nickmccarty0,Wes McKinney (the  creator of Pandas) created a data visualization library called Altair that produces dashboards from dataframes for quicker EDA. You should check it out!,2,09/10/2018 06:13 PM
Ulysses Foreman,"Hey Jason I created a few excel reports to my manager after I manipulated the data in pandas. I'm struggling to find data visuals that are richer and easier to format than Excel, have you found plot.ly to be your go to for data visuals?",1,30/03/2019 08:21 PM
Ahmad Rajab,"Brilliant tutorial Jason, I love Excel and Python but have always jumped to the tried and tested spreadsheets/methods rather than switching to Python; you've now inspired me to just do it. I hope you're ok if I reach out to you with queries!",1,20/04/2019 01:11 PM
