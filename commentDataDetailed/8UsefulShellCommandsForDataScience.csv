Massimo Franceschet,"Hi,

thanks for this useful tutorial, I will propose it to my data science students. Just a couple of comments (I am using shell of MacOS Sierra):




Command

$ sed ""s/, ?,/,,/g"" adult.csv >  adult.csv

zeros the output file adult.csv. I used this instead:

sed ""s/, ?,/,,/g"" adult.csv >  adult2.csv

mv adult2.csv adult.csv

Command

$ cat adult_sample.csv header.csv   > adult_sample_with_header.csv

should be

$ cat header.csv adult_sample.csv  > adult_sample_with_header.csv

I tried to sort unique workclasses in decreasing order but does not work properly (probably because of lexicographical order)

$ cut -d "","" -f 2 adult.csv | sort | uniq -c | sort -r

Ming Zhong,"Nice and helpful writing!

When you use  

cat adult_sample.csv header.csv > adult_sample_with_header.csv

to concatenate the header and sample files, I don't quite understand why put the header below the sample.",2,26/08/2018 12:31 PM
