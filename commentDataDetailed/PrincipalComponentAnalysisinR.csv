Dexter Pante,"Just a question, in the graph where you plotted PC1 and PC2, you said that ""hp, cyl and disp all contribute to PC1"".  Does this mean that wt and carb do not contribute to PC1? And what was the explanation for this.  I'd like also to know of all the variables you mentioned that contribute to PC1 which one has the most contribution?

Thank you for taking time to read my comment.  I hope you could enlighten me on this.",5,10/11/2018 06:02 PM

JEREMIAH KABISSA,"Dear Luke 

How are you. My name is Jeremiah Joe Kabissa a student of KU Leuven, I real want to learn different tactics of using R, for various analytical tools. However for now I real like to learn PCA in R, FA in R, PLS in R and the like in relation to the former three.

Sincerely

Jeremiah",1,16/11/2018 01:17 AM
Simone Schütz,  Thanks. How to adapted the PCA if my data includes missing values?,1,20/11/2018 08:22 PM
Tram Ly,"Dear Luke ,

Thanks you so much for your lesson 

I don't understand about interpreter result with  "" the  Japanese cars, on the other hand, are characterized by high mpg"" because I think low mpg is right because the   arrow of mpg  is  on negative side. 

I am so appreciate if you explain 

Thanks you so much     ",4,22/11/2018 12:52 AM
Abdellatif EL MSAYRYB,"Hello, i'm trying to install the ggbiplot package but doesn't  work for me, is there a difference between the ggplot package and ggbiplot in the python 3 ?  ",1,11/12/2018 02:46 PM
Elijah Juma,"Hi Luke,

I'd like to understand the intuition behind how the grouping has been done. Would you be able to offer additional explanation?

Izzy Bizzy,"Hello,

I have heard that the output obtained through PCA analysis can be used as predictors in regression. For example, if you have two data sets: A contains the results of an experiment with each row representing a participant response, B contains (highly variable) social information about each participant in the study. I would like to perform a PCA analysis on data set B and use the resulting vectors as predictor variables in a mixed effects regression performed on data set A. In other words, I am trying to test how can social factors account for participant behavior. How would I go about including those principal components in my regression? I am familiar with mixed effects regression in R but if anybody can provide some sample code to achieve this, that would be great.

Thanks!
