Ashik Shafi,"You mentioned Random Forest  in the ""Model Generation"" paragraph at the bottom while discussing NB. Was it a typo or you actually mean RF? Are RF and NB same thing?",4,11/12/2018 09:13 PM
Samuel S,"Thanks, interesting tutorial. The ""Zero Probability Problem"" is a good hint.

I think that the example in ""Second Approach (In case of multiple features)"" is mathematically incorrect. The probability P(Play=Yes | Weather=Overcast, Temp=Mild) = 1. In equation (1) the denominator with P(Weather=Overcast, Temp=Mild) is missing. Furthermore, in equation (2), the result should be P(Weather=Overcast, Temp=Mild | Play=Yes) = P(Overcast | Yes, Mild)*P(Mild | Yes) = ... = 1/9 (just look it up in the table! => Overcast and Mild given Yes). By the way, the sum of P(Yes|O,M) + P(No|O,M) = 1 (=> he either plays or he doesn't play - there is no other option).

I also have some questions: 

Why is a LabelEncoder used? Does GaussianNB() only work with numbers?
I'm a bit confused about the independence condition. Does the Naive Bayes Algorithm due to the independence assumption indeed use P(O,M|Yes) = P(O|Yes)*P(M|Yes) as it is written in eq. (2) of the second example?",2,13/12/2018 04:22 AM

Agustín Guíñez Reyes,"Thanks for the tutorial, It's very useful!  I am new here, so I was wondering if there is a way to download directly the whole python script or it is necessary to copy and paste the entire code chunk by chunk.",1,17/12/2018 05:43 AM
Nithya Grace Nexo,"I get an  error while executing model.fit(features,label) in the weather forecast data. Please help me fix it.

ValueError: Expected 2D array, got scalar array instead:
array=<zip object at 0x1a19045f88>.
Reshape your data either using array.reshape(-1, 1) if your data has a single feature or array.reshape(1, -1) if it contains a single sample.

久 宇,"P (Yes | Overcast) = 0.44 * 0.64 / 0.29 = 0.98(Higher)

If you use that

P(Yes∩Overcast)/P(Overcast)= (4/14)/(4/14) =1

, the probability of P (Yes | Overcast) will be 1.

Because P(Overcast |Yes) = 4/9 = 0.44 has some measurement error.",3,18/03/2019 08:36 AM

Noris Junior,"Good article. But in ""Probability of not playing"":  ""2. Calculate Posterior Probabilities: P(Weather=Overcast |Play=No) = 0/9 = 0"", although the result is correct, the math is 0 / 5 not 0 / 9.",2,28/03/2019 12:35 AM
Ritik Ranjan Baidyanath,"Fine tutorial, easy to learn and well understood. 

just the first example when you are creating the features by features= zip(weather_encoded, temp_encoded). Make that features= list(zip(weather_encoded, temp_encoded))  else it will show an error in the line when you are training the model in python 3.5.   ",2,24/04/2019 09:42 PM
