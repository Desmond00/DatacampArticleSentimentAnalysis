Daron Prater,"This is a great tutorial and I found it very helpful! 

One question, when doing the K-means clustering, would it be advantageous to scale the data prior to running the algorithm? I ask because some of the data like batting average are anywhere from 0-.5 where as hits and runs can range from 370-1067 and because this calculates the euclidian distance the different magnitudes in data would impact the clustering results.

Overall great stuff, thanks for putting this together",3,06/10/2018 08:03 AM
Christian Johansson,"Great turorial, I have a question though.

Why did you split thae data like 

""""""

Split data DataFrame into train and test sets

train = data.sample(frac=0.75, random_state=1)

test = data.loc[~data.index.isin(train.index)]

X_train = train[attributes]

y_train = train['W']

X_test = test[attributes]

y_test = test['W']

""""""

And not with a train_test_split?
