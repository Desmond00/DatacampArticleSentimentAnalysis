Sai Charan Adurthi,"Hi,

I am confused with the decision of saying that its ""Up"" if probability is > 0.5, else ""Down"".




Can someone explain me why is it that we consider .positive result /  label for greater probability and negative result / label for lower probability ??

Ala Qabaja,Shouldn't the logistic function be 1/(1 + eB0+B1X) rather than (eB0+B1X)/(1 + eB0+B1X)  ? ,1,16/03/2019 02:23 AM
Elena Ghezzo,"Hi, 

I have to change this part of the code

  

glm.fit <- glm(Direction ~ Lag1 + Lag2 + Lag3 + Lag4 + Lag5 + Volume, data = Smarket, family = binomial)

with a longest list of dependent variables (more than one hundred). Is there a way to list the columns interval instead of each dependent variable?

example ""Dataset"":

type    X1     X2   ... X100

A          15       13  ...  . 1

B           11     2      ... .83

B           3        22   .... 65

B           15     23   ...   22

 type.fit<- glm( type~X1+X2+...X100, data = Dataset , family = binomial)
