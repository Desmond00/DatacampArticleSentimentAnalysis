Heike Wendt,"Hello, nice tutorial, but the definition of any for tuples is wrong.
any will return True when at least one of the elements is Truthy.
Therefore your example above:  a=(1,), any(a) will return True.  ",5,20/02/2018 05:39 PM

Bharat Ruparel,You should add a section on 'named' tuples as they are the most useful manifestation of tuples in real-life application in my opinion,4,20/02/2018 08:33 PM

Robin Dale,"The following example code prints ""True"" not ""False"" as shown above.

a=(1,)

print(any(a))

Maybe the first line of code should have been a = (0,) or similar?",3,21/02/2018 09:25 AM
Robin Dale,"And maybe a quick mention that the return value from the sorted function when applied over a tuple is a list, not another tuple, otherwise great  tutorial. Thanks!",3,21/02/2018 09:32 AM
