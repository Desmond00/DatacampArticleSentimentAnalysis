Great Tutorial. Thanks for taking us through tensorflow. I have a few doubts.

1. What are all the Loss Functions & Optimizing Algorithms. How to select one based on the task (i.e.) where to use which ?

2. Graph Function - where to define it ?

3. How many layers are there in this ? can we increase or decrease the number of layers?

4. I am getting an error as ""Not enough dimensions"" while trying to plot the image using ""plt.imshow(image, cmap=""gray"")"". This error occurs only when i use ""images28 = rgb2gray(images28)""

5. I tried using the same example, changed the images to my images and tried. I am getting Memory Error. Any help is much Appreciated!!
