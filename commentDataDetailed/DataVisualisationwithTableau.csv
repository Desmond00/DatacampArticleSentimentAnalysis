roshan shetty,"Thanks for this tutorial. I was trying to follow along and I got stuck with Point 4. Map View. It looks under Creating Hierarchies, sub-point 3 is missing. That probably should have information about how to create inclusion sets which is used in the subsequent sub-point. If you could provide that information, it would be helpful.",1,23/03/2019 09:12 AM
Dēmetrijs Mērkaziņš,"The links to the file SampleSuperStore don't work. Also, Roshan is right. The hierarchies section is messy. How did you use N-Filter? Where do the Inclusions come from?",1,23/03/2019 10:00 PM
