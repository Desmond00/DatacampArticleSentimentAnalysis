Johan Haggle von Neubrücke,"From the article above:

""An iterator is an object that implements the iterator protocol (don't panic!).""

""Python has  several built-in objects, which implement the iterator protocol and you  must have seen some of these before: lists, tuples, strings,  dictionaries and even files.""

This implies that a list is an iterator, but I learn from otherwhere that it is not. The article is somewhat vague and unclear and should be updated.
