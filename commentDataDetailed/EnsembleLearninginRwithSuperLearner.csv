yinlong,"Hi,

When I do prediction after getting the model, because of having a single value factor column in the test, it reports error.  Actually in my training set, the factor column has two levels, while when split, the test set gets identical value for the column, so it reports ' contrasts can be applied only to factors with 2 or more levels',  how can we solve it?",2,06/09/2018 09:44 AM
