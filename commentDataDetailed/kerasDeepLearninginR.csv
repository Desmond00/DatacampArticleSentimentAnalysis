Rahma MEDDEB,"hi,

i get this error

> iris.trainingtarget <- iris[ind==1, 5]

Error in iris[ind == 1, 5] : subscript out of bounds

> iris.testtarget <- iris[ind==2, 5]

Error in iris[ind == 2, 5] : subscript out of bounds




please help me

metroac,"Hello,

After running the following line, I get an error (below).

The script: 

model %>% fit(iris.training, iris.trainLabels, epochs = 200, batch_size = 5, validation_split = 0.2)

The error:

Error in py_call_impl(callable, dotsargs,dotskeywords) : 

ValueError: No data provided for ""dense_3_input"". Need data for each key in: ['dense_3_input']




Any comment, solution, or help is appreciated. ",1,03/04/2018 03:05 AM
Manal ali,"Thanks Karlijn for great effort. 

I have one  question please, how can I get the features that are learned from hidden layers, for this model or autoencoder model? is there any function to get the features from specific hidden layer?




Thanks in advance ",3,07/04/2018 06:21 PM
MARCOS GRZECA,"Congratulations, very good.

Do you have any Keras manual for word processing?

Wenfang Cai,"Hi,  this is a extremely great tutorial, I have learned a lot from this tutorial.

But when I running the code of fitting the model:

model %>% fit(

     iris.training, 

     iris.trainLabels, 

     epochs = 200, 

     batch_size = 5, 

     validation_split = 0.2

I have entered this problem:

Error in py_call_impl(callable, dotsargs,dotskeywords) : ValueError: No data provided for ""dense_3_input"". Need data for each key in: ['dense_3_input']

all codes is the same as the tutorial, could you help me?

Thank you!",1,14/04/2018 11:42 PM
Mahfoud Sidi Ali Mebarek,"Note that normalization will result in shrinking the matrix to 4 columns, which will erase the labels (5th column) and result in errors when getting the training and test targets, I did the following to solve it :


iris_original <- iris
iris <- normalize(iris[,1:4])
----
iris.trainingtarget <- iris_original[ind==1, 5]
iris.testtarget <- iris_original[ind==2, 5]",4,21/04/2018 02:57 AM

I'm getting the below error at the ""One hot encode training"" stage:

Steven Njuki,"A great article thanks a lot!! 

Does keras uses deep learning with 'encoding' hidden layers? Am a newbie and I read this in  another article. Am interested in deep learning.",1,04/10/2018 11:45 PM
Marcel Steiner-Curtis,"Very good tutorial! Thanks a lot.
If you normalise the data would it not be better to normalise the trainingset and the testset individually?
Otherwise (I  belive) you mix information from the whole dataset which contains the testset into the trainingset.
What is a comon practice?

ibu int,"Hi,

Great tutorial. I learn a lot from it. 

Just wanna ask, is it possible to create a single classification model?

For example, I wanted to create an image classification model that can classify ""Cat"" only. What kind of adjustment should i made?

Any advise will be helpful. 

Thank you.",1,20/02/2019 03:10 PM
