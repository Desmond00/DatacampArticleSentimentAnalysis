dvoiakstepan,"In ""How To Set Plot Title And Axes Labels""    

The easiest way to set these things right is by using ax.set(title=""A title"", xlabel=""x"", ylabel=""y"") or ax.set_xlim(), ax.set_ylim() or ax.set_title().

May be ax.set_xlabel(), ax.set_ylabel() nor ax.set_xlim(), ax.set_ylim()",4,12/04/2018 08:46 PM

naveen ganpat,"Dear Karlijn,

I enjoy your blogs/tutorials a lot. Recently I started working with the Datacamp Lite to insert some excercises. I was wondereing how did you manage to get two of these apps on the same page. Perhaps this is not the right place to ask this question but I am not able to see a community group to ask technical questions about the Datacamp Light. Would you  be able to point me to the right direction? Many thanks!",1,15/12/2018 03:53 PM

Samuel Schlatter,"Terrible tutorial like all others. Where do I save these files, where do I enter the commands, what do i need installed? Frankly quite disappointed with python users never giving the full story. I know there are many options and configurations but as a complete beginner there is no support for getting started",1,25/05/2019 07:08 PM
Randy Bonnette,"Anaconda package installer is also used to install not only Python, but also NumPy, SciPy and other libraries. And by the  way, Google Colab is a great tool for coding at once.

One of the resources I used for my case study on Matplotlib for companies is Matplotlib Tutorial: Learn basics of Python’s powerful plotting library to write my paper.",2,14/06/2019 11:11 AM
