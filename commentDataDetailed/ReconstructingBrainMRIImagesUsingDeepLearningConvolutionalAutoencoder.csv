Harsh Vardhan Sharma,"Hey Aditya, your tutorials are great. However, I am unable to load MINC data format in Python. Can you help me regarding it? http://brainweb.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/brainweb/about_data_formats.html",5,01/07/2018 02:10 PM
Sayak Paul,Hello Aditya. This tutorial is a gem. Thanks for covering so much that too in so short. Lovely and keep up the good work! ,3,31/08/2018 05:46 PM

The dataset is not available for download at the link.

Can you please give link to any other data that can be used?",5,11/10/2018 08:37 AM

Thank you for the tutorial, however my input images and also my masks are RGB, I don't have any problem 'till predicting my validation data but when I try to plot one of my predictions, the figure it give me is just white.

pred = model.predict(X_valid)  

plt.figure(figsize=(4, 4)) 

plt.imshow(pred[4]) 

plt.show()

the shape of my prediction data is 250*128*128*3 

how can I plot one of my predictions?",1,29/12/2018 07:57 PM
Brian Droncheff,"Really, a huge thanks for making this tutorial.

I did notice that when it is said ""It's time to check the shape of the numpy array, the first dimension of the array should be 207 x 30 = 6210 respectively and the remaining two dimensions will be 173 x 173. ""  it should be:  ""...  51 x 30 = 1530 respectively and the remaining two dimensions will be 173 x 173"". Just in case anyone gets confused. Note above only 51 of the 207 slices were taken.",3,22/04/2019 02:45 AM
Benjamin kluGah-Brown,"wow great work. Please i have some question.

Shouldn't the the image dimension be 173x173x207  rather?...173x173 the pixel 207 number of slice. instead of 173x207x173

Thanks",1,09/05/2019 11:48 AM
arjunbrom,"Hey Adithya, 

Great post. This tutorial is really helpful. 

Could you let me know how to modify the code if I need to use training and labels for each of the MRI image instead of the images used here.

As in, for each of the 51 slices taken in this example, how to assign the same label , which I am taking from the filename of the input Nifti file.

Below is the question posted with code that I have tried. 

As I have tried here I am able to get the labels for the number of images taken as the dataset, but its not matching with the image dimension as it is ""no.of images * slices""
