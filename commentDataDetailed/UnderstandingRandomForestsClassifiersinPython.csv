Fernando Fernandez,"Avinash,

In order to interpret a random forest, would it not be enough to read the feature contributions/importance?
I've been using this library https://github.com/andosa/treeinterpreter for that.",6,23/05/2018 02:30 AM

Nehmy FORBIN,"Hello Avinash,
First of all : thank you for this tutorial very accurate and receptive!
Then, I have a question : once you have got the feature importances, it could good to know in which way those features affect the target.
To be more clear a little ex : ""more the petal with is great, more the iris could be a setosa"".

Do you think, it's relevant to use a linear model (ex : logistic regression) to define that?

Naval Gupta,Can you please put some light on now to train with missing values rather than imputing with mean values,2,03/08/2018 10:32 AM
Malaya Swain,very good article for the beginners in machine learning. very well explained.,3,30/08/2018 07:51 AM
Martin Bertheau,"Nice tutorial, thank you.

Just a note: In the first part you use

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3)

and in the second example

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.70, random_state=5)

raj kumar,I need to build a model to find credit risk of a customer. My dataset contains 1000 rows out of which only 30 rows are having credit risk as 0 while other 970 has value as 1. So now my question is do i need to do anything in data preprocessing since data is more biased towards one side.. anyone can help?,2,24/03/2019 06:21 PM
