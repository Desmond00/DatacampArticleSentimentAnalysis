Sebastien Mitea,"Hello Hugo, in section ""A visual description of k-Nearest Neighbors"", the second line should end with ""blue"", not ""green"".

Well, if k=3, you would classify it as red and, if k=5, as blue.",7,20/02/2018 01:26 AM
Neeta Gupta,"Hi Hugo, I really liked the way you explain things, whether it be tutorial or datacamp courses. 

I have one query, how do you select random_state value while splitting data into training and testing. What is it exactly and how can we derive the value to be used?

Thanks,

Eli Michaelsson,"Hi

Should not you first split the data into training-test sets and then apply scaling only to the training set?

Thank you
