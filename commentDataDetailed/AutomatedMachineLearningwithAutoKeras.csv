DONGCHAN LEE,"Hi, thanks for the post. From above, when you prepared X_train & X_test, why did u add '+(1.)' in '.reshape()'?",2,29/11/2018 05:20 PM
Sujith Vemishetty,"First of all, kudos on the clear articulation of the concept in a no nonsense manner. It was a really good read. I would just like to point out few things, it is just nitpicking.

1) The term ""inversely proportional"" is not quite technically correct in the context used here as it is not necessary that the deadlines get shortened with increase in number of possibilities

2) I think you were meaning ""extremely exhausting"" when you talk about the search process of hyperparameter tuning, not ""exhaustive""

3) It is ""foolproof"" not full-proof

This is just a feedback for writing style, not a technical comment.",1,22/04/2019 12:19 PM
