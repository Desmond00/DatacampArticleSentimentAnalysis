Connor Hansen,"I believe in: 

 soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html') 

the  parser argument should be 'html.parser',  not just 'html. In Spyder I got an error telling me it defaulted to the lxml parser since I did not specify one.

I believe 'lxml' and 'html5lib' also specifies the parser argument (for their respective parsers), but for the built-in html parser, it is 'html.parser'. ",2,27/09/2018 02:52 AM
Ankur Phukan,"At `dh = datacamp[datacamp[""publishdate""]>='2017-01-01'].sort_values(by=""publishdate"", ascending=True).set_index([""publishdate""])` setindex drops the column which is set as index .. Solution 

`dh = datacamp[datacamp[""publishdate""]>='2017-01-01'].sort_values(by=""publishdate"", ascending=True).set_index([""publishdate"", drop=false])`  . And nice tutorial really learned may new things.",2,29/09/2018 08:24 PM

Balary Nash,"why did I get the error 'AttributeError: 'DataFrame' object has no attribute 'publishdate'' when I would input the code  "" dh[""publishdateone""] = pd.to_datetime(dh.publishdate.astype(str).str[0:7] + '-01') ""？I'm  new to python. Could you tell me how to solve that?",1,09/02/2019 12:53 PM
Jensen Ko,"HI, i was stuck on 

datacamp = pd.read_csv(""D:\\Python Beautiful Soup\\datacamp01042019.csv"", parse_dates=[""publishdate""], infer_datetime_format=True)

Please can someone shed me a light. Thanks.",1,07/04/2019 02:52 PM
