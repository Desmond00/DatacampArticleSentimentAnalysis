thomas,"In the second bullet point of the first section, ""answer"" is misspelled as ""anser"" - unless I'm missing something pythonic.",1,03/04/2018 02:03 AM
knowledge base,"Thanks for post, but grey code-font on a black background is barely readable. ",6,03/04/2018 06:35 PM
Thomas Pensaert,"It's a solid overview, but I can't see why this colour palette is used for the pictures. The palette is great whilst you're coding by yourself, but it's hard to read upon a website in my opinion.",2,04/04/2018 03:35 PM

Lee Strode,"I normally wouldn't comment on this BUT, your black background and grey text is almost impossible to read.  Please adjust contrast.",1,14/12/2018 01:00 AM
J David Eisenberg,"The contrast is too low to be readable for anyone without absolutely perfect vision. (For example, the first example of hanging indent is utterly unreadable and fails the WCAG tests for color contrast.)",1,07/02/2019 05:12 AM
Tushar Arora,Thanks for sharing such a useful blog on Python. I learn lots of things from yours blogs,1,04/04/2019 04:11 PM
Rich Lysakowski,"What a poorly formatted article.!!    The code is barely readable because it is so dark in many places.    I had to copy out all text to MS-Word and reformat it to read the dark text.   This is not a problem with my browser, it is the author's  or website owner's bad choice of HTML / CSS style template.    I've seen this mistake made many times in DataCamp website articles.  ",1,08/04/2019 08:33 AM
