Chris Caudill,"For the sake of sharing, I was only able to get the word length portion to work properly by removing distinct() when creating prince_word_lengths.

Rajesh Dorbala,"It was an amazing tutorial Debbie. I found an issue though very small but thought I could seek some help. I am not able to make a wordcloud in the shapes (guitar) and I am not even able to produce a letter word cloud. Can you please help me out in this issue.




Thanks

i883736,"Just a note on the use of TF-IDF here. This method is useful to distinguish how important a word is to a document (song in this  case) in relation to the corpus. Using it like here tells us very little, except for that there is a single song that uses purple a lot, or a single song that uses hide a lot",1,31/05/2018 02:01 AM
ashy Grace,"WOW!!!!! so detailed..

I thank you. I really do.




I had no idea i could do really cool word clouds,just for just. But the guitar one failed, i get the following error

""Error in wordcloud2(prince_words_counts[1:300, ], figPath = ""guitar_icon.png"", : cannot find fig in the figPath"" 




:(

For some reason, i have failed to run the first code. the one with the song count per year.

I get this error --> ""Error in lim(-20, 150) : could not find function ""lim""""

I am not sure  that the dataset  https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/blog_assets/prince_raw_data.csv is what you used. It has >40000 rows when downloaded to a dataframe.

balaji ganesan,"very nice tutorial... lot of info... 

Could you also help me understand how the data was scrapped from different websites... that itself would have no ordinary feat... code for gathering of the data would also be of much help for learning purposes for an End-to-End understanding....

Cheryl Tan,"Hi Debbie, this is a really interesting tutorial! I'm just getting started and this is probably a very basic question, but may I ask the difference between the following codes: 

prince
lyrics<−fix.contractions(prince
lyrics)

prince
lyrics<−sapply(prince
lyrics, fix.contractions)

There does not seem to be any difference I could see in the results hence I wondered why the sapply function needed to be used? Thanks in advance!",1,14/08/2018 08:54 PM

Sarasati Palawita,"Hi Debbie,

thanks a lot for the tutorial! It is really helpful :)

I am now working on Text Mining, to classify genre based on song's lyrics. 

I am using TF-IDF feature and Part of Speech Tag feature and train it with SVM, however I still could understand how does it work.

My dataset consists of  year, song, genre, lyric, language. 

I did tokenization with ngram (unigram and bigram) and from the result I did TF_IDF. I got the TD_IDF value per unigram/bigram. And now I am completely lost.

What suppose I do to train my data?  

Do I need to wrap my TF_IDF value to one document(per song) or just leave it like that (unigram/bigram) and then train the TF_IDF value to classify the genre?

Your feedback would be very appriciated! Thank you!

Phillip Hayes,"Great idea for app! I'm a junior Java developer and my huge challenge to myself in the field of development is just the creation of a program of learning to play the guitar, but not like not one. The advantage is that I myself am a beginner guitarist and just bought the best capo for acoustic guitar and the latest model of acoustic guitar for self-study. I believe that the process of self-education and the development of simultaneous software itself will provide a huge return on the development of a modern game for all who want to learn how to play the instrument.",2,01/05/2019 02:07 PM
