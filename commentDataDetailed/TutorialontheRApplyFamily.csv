CN SP,"is it normal that I am getting an error that says ""missing argument to function call"" when I am using lapply with the call separator, ""["" instead of putting an actual function in the FUN? 

I basically have a list of matrices that I want to collapse into one matrix and I've used this code: 

for (j in 1:5) {

  gamete_pool[[j]] <- matrix(unlist(lapply(gamete, ""["", j,)), ncol = 5, byrow = T)




Thank you in advance. 

}

My list contains 5 different matrices and instead of using the unlist function, I wrote my own lapply. ",4,03/08/2018 10:33 PM
