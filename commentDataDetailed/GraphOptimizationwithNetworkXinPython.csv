aaa,"Hi! Great tutorial. However, there is one problem with line:

odd_matching = list(pd.unique([tuple(sorted([k, v])) for k, v in odd_matching_dupes.items()]))

as it delivers the following error message: ValueError: Buffer has wrong number of dimensions (expected 1, got 2)

Do you know how to solve it?

Thanks a lot, Markus",4,10/03/2018 05:34 PM
Erkan ŞİRİN,At Visualize Color section the code should be  edge_colors = [e[2]['attr_dict']['color'] for e in g.edges(data=True)]  not  edge_colors = [e[2]['color'] for e in g.edges(data=True)] ,1,28/06/2018 11:59 AM

Bal Mb,"Hello There, 

I am have generated a random graph and created a loop that will search for the highest degree node and remove it and continue until the graph is disconnected. I have however failed to display the graph at each iteration .  Any Idea on how i can go about this?

 Thanks ",1,15/04/2019 05:15 AM
