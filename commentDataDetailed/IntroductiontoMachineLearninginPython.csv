Jason Rathgeber,"Great article thank you. 

Just one missing line I needed to add to run the whole tutorial w/o error : 

from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix

The tutorial produced very nice looking graphics and is an easy to understand treatment of this well known dataset.

Yuri Silva,"Very good tutorial! Intuitive and practical lessons!




I just had one doubt about the histogram part.

According to the author there were only unimodal distributions.

However, I believe the distribution of petal-length is multimodal.",1,27/12/2018 10:12 PM
Yanhui Yuan,"Nice and easy introductory tutorial, very good for beginners like me.

One issue:

 ""With just a few lines of code, you were able to train an ML model that  is now able to tell you the flower name by using only four features with  96.66% accuracy. ""

Actually only three features were used in the model.

 

train_data,test_data,train_label,test_label = train_test_split(dataset.iloc[:,:3], dataset.iloc[:,4], test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

 

train_data.shape,train_label.shape,test_data.shape,test_label.shape

 

((120, 3), (120,), (30, 3), (30,))

When the last feature is included, the accuracy plot looks very different. ",2,17/02/2019 01:45 PM
Dhruv Upadhyay,"Great Article! This was a really comprehensive, detailed, and helpful tutorial, especially as an introduction to machine learning. I was wondering, when choosing the k-value for optimization, why did you not use k=9? Based on my graph, k=9 seems to exhibit most accurate results, and when I run the algorithm with k=9 upon the test-set, it exhibits 100% accuracy. Is it because both test_accuracy=training_accuracy when k=3?

Thank you,

mastan paruchuri,"Hi Team,

This is Mastan.Paruchuri. first of all thanks for the post.it is very useful for beginners.

please let me know ,how to check correlation for the iris-versicolor and virginica in pandas.

I tried below one.is it correct?

Input:-

iris.iloc[50:100,:].corr() + iris.iloc[100:,:].corr()

Thanks,

Mastan.",1,05/05/2019 02:12 PM
