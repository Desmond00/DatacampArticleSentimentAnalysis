Hi Ahmed,

Thanks for the article. I have the following questions:

1) How would you suggest getting the graph of the classes to plot the decision boundary? Through unsupervisied learning?

2) Would the same concept be applicable for more complex cases (more classes)?

3) For the second example, what are the key considerations that lead you to do a 2-4-2-1 design instead of 2-4-1 design?

4) How can the same concept be applied for regression problem?",2,02/10/2018 01:07 PM
