Lisa Heye," 

addresses = re.findall(r'[\w\.-]+@[\w\.-]+', email_address)

I really don´t get why there is a dash in the pattern... and I couldn´t find any explanation that the dash is part of a special character. Please explain. Thanks!",2,05/03/2018 03:15 PM
Nishant Kumar," ? - Checks for exactly zero or one character to its left.

Didn't understand this, what does ""exactly zero or one"" means here? Does it mean if more than 1 match is found, result would be discarded?",1,21/03/2018 05:30 PM

Yousef x,"Very clear and easy to follow tutorial, thank you indeed.

I think there is a typo in the interactive python  at start of 'Groups and Grouping using Regular Expressions' section.

The second line is:

match = re.search(r'([w.-]+)@([\w.-]+)', ____________)

instead of:

match = re.search(r'([\w\.-]+)@([\w\.-]+)', ____________)",2,16/04/2018 09:36 PM
