Stephanie Margo Davis,"Thank You for this tutorial. I have a question relating to line 2 of the ""How To Define A Function: User-Defined Functions (UDFs)"" section. Should the word ""parameter"" replace ""arguments"" since parameters are used to define functions and methods? Thanks?",5,16/02/2018 02:07 PM

Vitaly Romas,"Thanks for this great tutorial. I have just one question. One of the fingrained examples of the functions uses return:

 

def hello():
  name = str(input(""Enter your name: ""))
  if name:
    print (""Hello "" + str(name))
  else:
    print(""Hello World"") 
  return 
  
hello()

The function works perfectly without return as well. Could you please  tell the reason of using return inside of the function?
