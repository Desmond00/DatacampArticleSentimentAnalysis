Jonas Aryee,Thanks Karlijn for the write up. I am not strong in maths and so had some doubt if i will succeed doing this but i now have the edge to go on. I will take it one day at a time,1,20/02/2018 09:57 PM
Angela Frank,"Hi Karlijin,




Thank you for writing this article, it was very helpful to me- someone who knows very little about computer science.

I had never before considered computer science as a career because I didn't think I was smart enough. I've recently been working on improving my math skills and gaining a deep understanding of math and have enjoyed it. I've even enrolled in classes that could lead up to a micro master's",1,27/02/2018 10:56 PM
Angela Frank,"Sorry, I didn't mean to post that quite yet!




I was just going  to say that I already have a master's degree in education and am a licensed mental health counselor so hopefully I already have at least some of the skills that potential employers are looking for! I would hate to have to go through the whole internship process again!",1,27/02/2018 10:58 PM

Kevin Burke,"Thanks Karlijn, appreciate the article.  One question though, I'm taking the Data Science track in Python with DataCamp and obviously it has a few Statistical Thinking in Python courses.  Wondering if you think (as I really do not have much of a math background) that I would be better supplementing my learning with your suggestions?  Thanks again.",1,15/03/2018 05:36 PM
beckyrichards35,"Hi there,

Thank you for the article, it is excellent!

I do not have a degree of any sort as of yet,

as I found the traditional learning route difficult.

Is there any way of getting into this career without a degree?",0,22/03/2018 03:01 PM
kein johnson,"Thanks for this post.  Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from data in various forms, both structured and unstructured, similar to data mining .  hotmail customer service has the details of data mining.",1,08/08/2018 03:01 AM
ucieajf,"Thanks for post.  This is a very computer science centric view.  A big, big gap here that will make the difference in your career is knowing about business, how it works etc. , what your employers need and problem construction and reframing it is probably harder than any Languages you'll learn.  Being able to translate your results succinctly and in an easy format should be on this list. ",3,16/08/2018 02:20 PM
pdhoyt,"Karlijn,   Thank you for the excellent article - especially appreciated the infographic.  Made me realize I have some work to do before I jump into a boot camp!",1,16/08/2018 10:47 PM
Ashwin Ramaswamy,This is absolutely brilliant :-) ,1,18/11/2018 03:31 PM
Guilherme Gabriel Paternostre Toledo,"My question is 

1- I have no math background whatsoever, I have a Bachelor degree in Theology and an MBA with focus in international business and foreign trade, still though I suck in Math.




Is DataCamp enough for me to focus in studying and getting started with freelance projects or even positions?  or I should study more by these steps in other websites?

BTW I am doing the whole Data Analyst track to get it started and later on Data Scientist.  Python first.",1,29/12/2018 10:21 PM
