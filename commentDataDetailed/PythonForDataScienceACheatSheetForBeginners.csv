Frank Lucido,"Great tips for beginners. I'm a Preparation & Certification educator, so last year I faced this issue with Python data science learning courses. I accomplished a Coursera tutorial and Python for data science essays agency 2 months online course. Now, I know at least the basics and can help other teachers with the data science reports.
