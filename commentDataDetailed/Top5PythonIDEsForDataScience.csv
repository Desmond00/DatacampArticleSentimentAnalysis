Dimitrios Bouziotas,"I use PyScripter and love it; it provides an interface closer to programming than data science. Its Code Explorer gives you more functionality than the Variable explorer of Spyder, which is more MATLAB-y and geared towards object types closer to data science (np.arrays, dataframes, lists, numeric et.). It also allows you to switch between different python versions installed. 

The downside is that it's windows only and that it's not part of the conda distribution (yet). ",1,13/12/2018 06:18 PM
Guillaume Martin,"It seems that since Yhat has been acquired by Alteryx, the Rodeo project has been abandoned.

If you look at their github repository, you'll see that there hasn't been any commit since January 2017.

I wouldn't put it in the list as there won't be any improvement or bug fix on this product.",3,22/12/2018 07:41 AM

Nikhil Praveen,Visual Studio Code is a very powerful IDE but my only problem with it is that it is very slow.,1,13/04/2019 02:53 PM
Nathaniel Ng,"I started with Atom, and am gradually switching over to Visual Studio Code (now that Microsoft has acquired Github, I suspect that the development paths of these two tools will eventually merge). The Python integration and git integration are awesome! and for the Python extension, it can be seen from their Twitter feed that they've been adding new features on a very regular basis.

It's currently the most popular IDE in the Stack Overflow 2019 survey, with 50%+ of developers using it (link here). Like Atom, it's MIT-licensed.",1,25/04/2019 07:42 AM
