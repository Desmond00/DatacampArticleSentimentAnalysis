Mayur Gilani,"Hello. Is there anything wrong in this paragraph?




""Queues can be of many different kinds but in this tutorial only discusses the most basic type. Lists are not efficient to implement a queue, because append() and pop() from the end of a list is fast. Also, insertion at the end and deletion from the beginning of a list is not so fast since it requires a shift in the element positions. ""




If this paragraph makes sense, then what data structure is more efficient for Queues specifically? ",1,24/04/2018 03:05 AM

Adding little more information about Queue and Linked List  implementation will definitely  improve the content  of this article.
