There is no month column in data14 

Do we need to create them ? Can you clarify this please ?

Khushboo Khandelwal,"Hi Sejal!

Great Tutorial:) 

I need some guidance, I am working on a project for a client, well not really working but it's part of my master's curriculum. The data set are real world data.  I have bunch of ordinal categorial variables (~20) as inputs and now I would need to cluster them to create market segmentation. These variables are actually scaled variables i.e. on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 being the lowest and 5 the highest range on that scale. While designing the survey questionnaire, we had ensured to maintained the uniformity i.e. all these ordinal categorical variables have fixed scale i.e. 1 to 5 to avoid any false positives and less data transformation. In short, each question is framed to address different aspects of consumer buying behaviors in short.

Now, I am trying to explore ways where I can form clusters using these variables. I also have their demographics data(Age,Gender, Income, Education, etc.,). I have never worked on ordinal categorical variables to create cluster as my understanding is limited to numerical/continuous variables only as k-means works really well based on euclidean distance principle.

Could you please suggest a way to work on this?

Appreciate your help!

Thanks!

Khushboo

Marta Jornet,"Hi, 

First of all, thanks for the article, its very interesting and the example is well explained. 

I'm not very familiarized with the NYC boroughs, but looking at some maps and at your example, I don't know if I'm understanding it well. 

I think that with k-means,  your are dividing your data (latitude and longitude) into 5 different groups. But this groups calculated by k-means, really don't match with the boroughs, do they?

I guess you are assuming that they are similar enough to the boroughs to assume each one of this calculated groups represent a borough? For instance Queens, in the map representation it is identified with the purple dots, but looking at a NYC map, this area looks more like Brooklyn than Queens.

Chris Leisner,"Suppose that, in the K-means algorithm, you want to use a distance measurement other than Euclidean distance. For example, you might want to use a distance measure that takes into account the curvature of the earth, rather than a distance measure that is only accurate for points in a plane.  Is there any way to run K-means with a different distance measure?",0,24/07/2018 02:26 AM
Matthew Whitaker,"Thanks for the great tutorial. Really clear and well explained.

There is one aspect I don't understand though:  the article suggests that the clustering is 'impressive' because it maps on to the real world boundaries, to some extent. This doesn't seem to me to be the measure of success (and I see in response to another question the author does say that any similarity is actually incidental). 

Wouldn't it be more interesting if the algorithm showed clusters that bore no resemblance at all to geographical boundaries, and isn't this more the purpose of the clustering (ie to uncover groupings that we weren't already aware of in the data)?",1,11/09/2018 05:06 PM
