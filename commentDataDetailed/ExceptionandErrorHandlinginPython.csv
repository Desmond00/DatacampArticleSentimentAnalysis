Martin Hvidberg,"in TypeError, it should not be:

try:    a=int(5)    b=str    c=a+b

but

try:    a=int(5)    b=str()    c=a+b

Since just str would be the string class itself, not an instance of it.",1,02/08/2018 09:22 PM
Martin Hvidberg,"in your example: except (IOError,ValueError) as e: you wont get an exeption. It's perfectely legal to .readline() from a read only file. In additon your open('myfile.txt) above is should likely be open('myfile.txt, ""r""), since you are only reading from this file",1,02/08/2018 09:39 PM
Martin Hvidberg,"Regarding finally. It usually goes in the end, like this.

>>> def divide(x, y):
...     try:
...         result = x / y
...     except ZeroDivisionError:
...         print ""division by zero!""
...     else:
...         print ""result is"", result
...     finally:
...         print ""executing finally clause""
...
