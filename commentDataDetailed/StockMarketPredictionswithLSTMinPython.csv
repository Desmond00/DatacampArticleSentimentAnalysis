Yaser Abdelaziz,"Hello Thushan Ganegedara,

First, thanks so much for this great tutorial, the other thing, could you recheck this part?

batch_labels[b]= self._prices[self._cursor[b]+np.random.randint(0,5)]

looks like it should use np.random.randint(1,5), as equations stated before (in this case N = 6).

Also I don't think this could be used for a real trading, it seems just predicting stock price going up if it was going up in the recent period, and vise-versa, is this observation right? are there an interesting observation about this I can't notice?",2,07/05/2018 01:58 PM

Ariana Lema-Driscoll,"Hi,

I was wondering if you could provide an explanation or interpretation of the visualizations. How would someone less familiar with these models explain what is being portrayed in the first versus second graph and what the red versus blue lines mean, particularly from a ""business"" perspective? 

Also, thank you for posting this tutorial. The only bug I found was with ""maintaining LSTM state for the prediction stage"" section. I added the last line to avoid issues with reuse of variables. I received an error re. variable scope without the last line below:




for li in range(n_layers):
   sample_c.append(tf.Variable(tf.zeros([1, num_nodes[li]]), trainable=False))
   sample_h.append(tf.Variable(tf.zeros([1, num_nodes[li]]), trainable=False))

   tf.get_variable_scope().reuse_variables()",3,20/06/2018 08:23 PM
Marina Longnickel,"Could you please explain what all these variable are?


def __init__(self,prices,batch_size,num_unroll):

         self._prices = prices

         self._prices_length = len(self._prices) - num_unroll

         self._batch_size = batch_size

         self._num_unroll = num_unroll

         self._segments = self._prices_length //self._batch_size


I'm guessing prices is the total number of price entries
Not sure what price_length is. I thought maybe it's number of prices per batch, but it doesn't look like it... Like if you have a set [1,2,3,4,5] with batch size = 2, then you have 4 batches, each with two elements. Where you get the number of batches from (num of prices - num of prices per batch + 1)
Isn't num_unroll just the number of batches? At least that's what it looks like from the example. But then you also have segments, which is what?


Also, where is it predicting the future price exactly? The graphs seem to just show the current days' prices. Unless it's just plotted a day back.

And lastly, how do I get back the original prices? I tried doing inverse_transform but it didn't quite work.

Joe Damuth,"As someone who has been developing for a few years but is pretty new to python I've found this work to be very insightful and well explained! Oddly enough the only thing I can't figure out is how to read the graph at the very end.  Would you be able to explain what the lines creating the graph are doing?  

For example the last red line in the Best Predictions overtime graph starts at a high and dips down mirroring the actual price movement direction. Do I interpret that as it knew there was going to be a drop but not necessarily what the price would be? Lastly after point 12,000 there are no red lines. Is that because they weren't graphed or they overlap so well with the blue lines that we just don't visually see them?

Lyn Cheese,"Hi Sir !
Thank you for your tutorial

I have some doubt that maybe you can clear out.

Firstly, after I read your explanation, I though the code will predict the 50 steps ahead of time.
But, I think your code is in the end just predicting a one step-ahead.

Your num_unrolling is how many steps back you run to get info from training data, to predict the one step ahead thing.
From there you run prediction to the future for n_predict_once times.
At this point, maybe this is what you mean by predicting 50 steps ahead, because n_predict_once is 50
But, if it work that way, then your prediction is hardly to even reach 50% accuracy.
Since we predict n_predict_once ahead, then I should observe only the tail from the red line, which is the 50th prediction ahead.
This value is in the end the 50th steps ahead prediction which we want.

So, if we compare the tail of each red line with the real price movement.
There are many times, where the red tail is going down while the price movement is up, and so the opposite.

In short, I wonder, what exactly you mean by ""able to predict stock price behavior correctly most of the time"" ?
Because it was not so.
Am I missing something ?

I have some questions in your current implementation:


When you have compared the results noted as predicted and actual data in the graphs, was true data given as input for the future predictions? I mean for the future predictions, as you are doing single step prediction, say to predict values of a day after tomorrow I will have to have tomorrow's data (assuming each time step interval is a day), but in practice we don't really have the true data of tomorrow, though we can obviously use predictions of tomorrow from the today's data but there would be some error in it, which dramatically increases as we go farther in the future to predict. Though multi step predictions work better but are not as good as when we do predictions based on true data, also results are not really robust and are very much depend upon the step size. ",1,26/05/2019 03:20 PM
