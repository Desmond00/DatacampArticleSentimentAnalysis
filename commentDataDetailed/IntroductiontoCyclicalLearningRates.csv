Dan Shawul,"I don't think this is correct. The CLR run, without running the training & inference with no CLR, gives pretty bad accuracy of 98.65% and a baseline error of 2.32%. Something is passed on from the first training run without CLR if you have both tests at the same time.

Result with CLR code  and then non-CLR code commented out:

Baseline Error: 2.32%

Arpit Sisodia,What is the need of window( optimal learning rate range)  for learning rate when you have already plotted all learning rate vs/ accuracy plot. ,0,29/03/2019 05:36 PM
