Daniel Salamanca,"Hello,




Thanks for share this useful article. I have a doubt about 

highchart() %>%  

 hc_xAxis(categories = categories_grouped) %>%   

hc_add_series(data = mpgg, type = ""bar"", hcaes(y = count, color = manufacturer),              

   showInLegend = FALSE)

Because my dataset says when I run from 

Version:1.0 StartHTML:0000000107 EndHTML:0000001527 StartFragment:0000000127 EndFragment:0000001509  

highchart() %>%
+   hc_xAxis(categories = categories_grouped) %>%
+   hc_add_series(data = mpgg, type = ""bar"", hcaes(y = count, color = manufacturer),
+                 showInLegend = FALSE)

Says this

Version:1.0 StartHTML:0000000107 EndHTML:0000000897 StartFragment:0000000127 EndFragment:0000000879  

Error in mutate_impl(.data, dots) : 
  Column `y` is of unsupported type quoted call",1,01/09/2018 10:49 AM
