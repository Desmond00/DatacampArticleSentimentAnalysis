Alex Warren,"A Python variable name must begin with an alphabetic character or an underscore and may contain alphanumeric characters and an underscore. And besides, the name of the variable should not coincide with the name of the keywords in the Python language. There are not so many keywords, I remember them well because I write my paper for me with a cheat sheet, but honestly learn them easily: and, like, assert, break, class, continue, def, del, elif, else, except False, finally for, from, global, if, import, in, is, lambda, None, non-local, not or pass, raise, return, True, try, while, with, yield.

A variable stores data from one of the data types. Although this is not my specialty, but I remember that at the university we were told that there are many different types of data in Python, which are divided into categories: numbers, sequences, dictionaries, sets:

- boolean - true or false

- int - represents an integer number for storage, which uses 4 bytes in the computer's memory.

- float - represents a floating-point number, for storage of which 8 bytes are used, for example, 1.2 or 34.76.

- complex - complex numbers

- str - strings, for example ""hello"". In Python 3.x, strings represent the Unicode character set.

- bytes - a sequence of numbers in the range 0-255

- byte array - a byte array, similar to a byte with a difference that can be changed

- list 

- tuple 

- set - an unordered collection of unique objects

- frozen set is the same as a set, it just cannot change (immutable)

- dict - a dictionary in which each element has a key and a value",1,10/12/2018 08:22 PM
