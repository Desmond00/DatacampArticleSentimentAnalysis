Andres Salgado,"Debbie, what a thorough analysis on Prince's song lyrics.  You touch on every academic aspect required to validate an analysis such as this one.  I will soon take an approach at sentiment analysis on memorable speeches using the shared knowledge you have shown on this post.

ashy Grace,"Sorry, i realize my previous question was posted on the wrong page.




I get an error that reads --> ""Error in lim(-20, 150) : could not find function ""lim"""" while trying to run the song count per year code.




Did you write a separate function for it? My R.version is 3.5.0",1,18/06/2018 02:43 PM
Debbie Liske,"@ashy Grace, Yes! There is a sentiment lexicon in the tidytext package called ""loughran"" that is specific to the financial domain, so replace ""bing"" or ""nrc"" with ""loughran"". See this link for more detailed information: https://bit.ly/2K4OCyM

In the dataset of Prince events consist only two columns ""year"",""events"". Initially you started coding with ""Prince_new.csv"" which contains additional data.

Could you please guide me to find out the dataset?",2,21/07/2018 06:33 AM

Jennifer Spore,"Hi and thank you for this awesome tutorial! Question: I get the following message for the last code block for pairwise correlation:

Selecting by correlation
Warning message:
Trying to compute distinct() for variables not found in the data:
- `row_col`, `column_col`
This is an error, but only a warning is raised for compatibility reasons.
The operation will return the input unchanged.

How can I resolve this? Code entered is:

prince_tidy %>%
group_by(word) %>%
filter(n() >= 20) %>%
pairwise_cor(word, song, sort = TRUE) %>%
filter(item1 %in% c(""love"", ""peace"", ""gangster"", ""hate"")) %>%
group_by(item1) %>%
top_n(7) %>%
ungroup() %>%
mutate(item2 = reorder(item2, correlation)) %>%
ggplot(aes(item2, correlation, fill = item1)) +
geom_bar(stat = 'identity', show.legend = FALSE) +
facet_wrap(~item1, scales = 'free') +
theme_lyrics() + theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_blank()) + 
 xlab(NULL) + ylab(NULL) +
ggtitle(""Pairwise Correlation"") +
coord_flip()

RANDI HUGHES,"This is a very helpful post and I have used it to do my own sentiment analysis of and internal survey. I am have been able to run all the graphs with my own data except the pairwise comparisons and correlations.I am able to get the graphs but the x-axis aren't making sense. For example my pairwise correlations for the word ""improve"" has all 7 words showing nearly 100% correlation. When I initially create the pwc dataset I get the following message: 

Trying to compute distinct() for variables not found in the data:

- `row_col`, `column_col`

This is an error, but only a warning is raised for compatibility reasons.

The operation will return the input unchanged.

If you have any advice it's much appreciated! ",2,17/09/2018 12:26 AM
