Masood Sadat,"I enjoyed reading this tutorial and learned new things. I have a question in these lines that I think was not answered. Sometimes, I use loops to do an iterative task, and I store the results in a vector. Is there a more efficient alternative?

m=20
odd=numeric()

for (k in 1:m) {
   if (!k %% 2)
      next
      odd <- c(odd,k)
}
odd

Manny Inwang,"Hello, I am trying to use a for loop in r in this form 

for I=n-1:-1:1

How do I go about it? I want the indexing to decrease from the highest to the lowest 

lets say n = 6

I want the calculation to be from i[6], i[5]........i[1] 

I used seq() but that is not working for me

Cheers,",1,02/04/2018 01:46 AM
Kevin Jay Kaufman Ortiz,"I had to use for loops but within the for loops I included verctorization. A combination of both seems to make readability easier for many different iterative processes.

Very helpful article, I've been wondering on how to improve my efficiency in R and accidentally tumbled here. Thanks!",1,12/07/2018 05:11 PM
Aimé Okoko,"Thanks for this helpful post. I'd like to know how to transform variables in logarithm and store them in new columns.

For example I have three numeric variables : 'age', 'speed' and 'wealth'; and I want to create new columns named 'log_age', 'log_speed' and 'log_wealth' in the same dataframe

How could I use loops or vectorization to do this?",1,13/11/2018 06:18 AM
