Kevin Stam,"Hi, I've been trying to load dplyr in my library with library(dply), but I'm running into these errors...

Error in loadNamespace(j <- i[[1L]], c(lib.loc, .libPaths()), versionCheck = vI[[j]]) : 

  there is no package called ‘pillar’

In addition: Warning message:

package ‘dplyr’ was built under R version 3.3.3 

Error: package or namespace load failed for ‘dplyr’







When I try to load tidyverse with library(tidyverse), I receive 

Error in loadNamespace(j <- i[[1L]], c(lib.loc, .libPaths()), versionCheck = vI[[j]]) : 

  there is no package called ‘broom’

In addition: Warning message:

package ‘tidyverse’ was built under R version 3.3.3 

Error: package or namespace load failed for ‘tidyverse’




Each time it leads to install a new package...

.....Any ideas ?",1,01/05/2019 08:30 PM
