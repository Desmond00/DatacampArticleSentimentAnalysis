Tomislav Gelo,"Thank you for sharing this!




While installing the miniconda/anaconda package I get the following error.




 Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh: line 333: bunzip2: command not found
tar: This does not look like a tar archive
tar: Exiting with failure status due to previous errors 




Do I need to install some kind of unzip tool first? Did you also had this issue?




Thanks,

John Davis,"Two questions.  1. How do we tag a tutorial for future reference?  ie. in our datacamp accoount is there anyway to save this particular tutorial?  2. How to add a package to a google cloud datalabvm?  I'm asking this because tensorflow has ffmpeg support if the underlying binary is installed on the vm.  I've found notes about how to use apt inside of a datalab cell and it has supposedly installed ffmpeg, but when I ssh to the instance I do not find ffmpeg in my path.",1,09/07/2018 06:47 PM

Jesper Termansen,"Great tutorial - thank you. 

Would it be possible to execute all the steps in the tutorial  via scripts ? I mean - there is a lot of GUI steps that I would like to bypass with a smart setup involving scripts. 

How would that work ?  Can you recommend a blog on this topic or would it be possible to show how you do it ?

Thank you. 

Cheers, Jesper.",1,31/12/2018 03:19 PM
