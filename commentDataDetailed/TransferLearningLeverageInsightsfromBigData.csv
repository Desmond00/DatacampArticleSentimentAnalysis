V K,"Hi Lars, 

its been a bit of struggle to re-train pre-trained.  You said: "" you could train the word embeddings for the domain-specific words, by starting from pre-trained word embeddings ""

What would you suggest to re-train google word2vec  with domain corpus. I do have large domain corpus but not large enough.

thanks a lot, vk",1,07/12/2018 02:08 AM
