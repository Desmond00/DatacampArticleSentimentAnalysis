Michael Heder,"In the 'filter' section the given code returns [0, 0, 1, 1].

I replaced it with [x for x in feet if x%2] and got the expected list 'uneven'",1,27/04/2018 03:04 PM
lujotu,"Hi there!  Thanks for the tutorial, much appreciated.  Under the section "" List comprehension as an alternative to..."" you have the output of a for loop listed as [2,4,8,16,36,64] instead of [....32....].  Typo I'm guessing, just wanted to throw it out there.

Aaron Dude,"Nice tutorial. 

The plural of math is math, not maths.

Typo near the beginning when talking about converting mathematical expressions to comprehensions.  When explaining the code for list S you say ”... element x, which is raised to the power of 10.”  I believe that is the power of 2.",1,14/05/2019 06:30 AM
