James Langbein,"Thanks for the great examples here, they're very clear and well explained, I learned something.

I do have a question...

In the ""Multiple If Conditions"" section the  multi-ifs in the dict comprehension are written as:

 ... if v>2 if v%2 == 0 if v%3 == 0} 

and then in the for loop example the equivalent is written as:

if (v>=2 and v%2 == 0 and v%3 == 0):

The first 'v' condition in the for loop has a '>=', but not in the comprehension, which just has the '>'... is this correct? Am I missing something in terms of a difference in the logic?
Thanks",1,18/08/2018 06:35 PM

Nick Chepurniy,"Small typo - nothing serious but would look nicer:

dict_variable = {key:value for (key,value) in dictonary.items()}

                                                                                                   ^

 SHOULD BE:

dict_variable = {key:value for (key,value) in dictionary.items()}
