Gary Revell,"Nice article and I'm following it avidly, however.... when I do my first set of 20 epoch it's taking on average 210 secs per epoch. Do I really need to do 20 epochs as per the article?

Any ideas on how to speed it up? I'm running in a Jupyter Notebook on Windows 10.

Thanks",1,05/03/2018 08:22 PM
Shrikant Pandey,"Hello @ Aditya Sharma

I am following every instruction as you explained in this tutorial , but when use Dropout method my model become more worst compare to first model.

1. First Model gives  the almost same results  to me as you explained 

2. But when i use dropout method this model become more worst comp are  to first model

Tell me what is the reason behind the worst model

By the way i am run this program on cpu with 8GB ddr4 memory

ハプ アベスンダラ,"Hello Mr. Sharma

Thanks for the valuable article.

By the way I have a problem.

Currently I am on project  of churn prediction using Python and Keras.

However the model training takes long time without a GPU.

I want install a GPU.

There are lots of varieties with large price range when check on the internet.

It would be grateful If you could recommend me a suitable one within a US$ 250.

Specifications of my PC is

Windows 10 64 bit

Intel i3

16MB RAM

Thank you very much.

Aamir Khan,"Hi Aditya! excellent  and very helpful article on cnn.

I' am new to cnn. I have data set .png format. Do i need to convert it to gray scale ? if yes then how can i convert it to gray scale?",1,12/07/2018 01:26 PM
Tosin Tubi,"Great Article.

Followed every step keenly, except the training process is very slow. 

1st Epoch took about 35 mins,  2nd epoch took 40 mins.

I'm running  jupyter notebook on a Windows 10 64bit CPU 12GB Memory. 

Any ideas on how to make the traing faster on CPU ??",1,18/07/2018 09:32 PM
Owais Ahmad,"Great explanation on CNN, I am very new to deep learning and it helped me a lot. Although I am facing a problem that when I write the line

Can I ask a question?

 How did you learn these modules, e.g., pandas, numpy, pytorch, tensorflow, keras, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn……. They are too many! I don’t know how to start my study. Could you give me any help? Thanks. ",2,03/12/2018 01:34 PM

Ladi Sandeep Kumar,Hello Mr.Aditya.Thanks for such a wonderful tutorial.Can you please add a code which will show the images of features extracted by each layer of CNN model designed by you.This will make this tutorial helpful for beginners like me.,3,03/02/2019 07:35 AM
Flavio Mesquita,"Hi,

I'm following this tutorial step by step, but when I try to train the model it gives me an error:

ValueError: Error when checking input: expected conv2d_10_input to have 4 dimensions, but got array with shape (48000, 28, 28)

Why this? I'm simply copying and pasting your code to my Jupyter Notebook.",1,20/02/2019 11:30 PM
