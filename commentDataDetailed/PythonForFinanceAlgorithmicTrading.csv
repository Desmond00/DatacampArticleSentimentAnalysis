Greg Pascaran,"Karlijn, great tutorial, but I had a question: I am following this tutorial using my own environment, and up until the Big DataFrame section, it was all working fine. I am encountering an error when executing this line of code: ().pivot('Date', 'Ticker', 'Adj Close')  

This works fine when using the embedded code window, but unsure why it doesn't work in an environment that has been working perfectly until now.

Do you have any tips?",1,14/08/2018 09:16 AM
Tom Detzel,"Hi folks,  I'm having a similar problem to Greg -- this line of code: 

daily_close_px = all_data[['Adj Close']].reset_index().pivot('Date', 'Ticker', 'Adj Close')

Not working. I'm getting a bad result -- identical closing values for each Ticker on each Date.

I've tried multiple fixes and the pivot (or pivot_table) reproduces the same mistake. 

What gives?
