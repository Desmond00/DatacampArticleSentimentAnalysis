Billy Hall,great tutorial! Thank you for such detailed and carefully prepared explanations. I would like to try some of these techniques but can't seem to find any link so I can see the structure and format of your source files.

Leon Schelhase,"Thank you Debbie. This series of articles is excellent and hugely helpful. I have been dabbling in text analytics for a year or so now, and your tutorials together with the tidytext package have been the most informative and presented in a way that its easy to follow along and adapt if necessary.

I am curious though, what package did you use to lemmatise the Prince lyrics and establish whether its a noun/verb/ pronoun etc?

Thanks again",3,14/07/2018 08:22 PM

Laura C.,"Hi Debbie, thank you so much for these informative and well-researched tutorials! They actually inspired me to start my own work on text mining and topic modelling, currently I'm trying it on a dataset with over 20,000 songs of various genres. I was having some trouble setting up the clean NLP package for POS-tagging, though and was wondering whether you might have any tips or recommendations how to properly connect to the Python or Java back-end? (since for some reason it won't work for me yet, I tried the Spacy library from Python...) 

thanks again for your fantastic work!",2,28/09/2018 08:56 PM
Ahmed Khan,"Hello Debbie,

Thank you for a nice article.

I also used non negative matrix Factorization (NMF) for topic modeling. You used here LDA.

Any idea which one is better, and what are the main differences between them.




Thanks,
Ahmed Khan",2,13/10/2018 06:53 AM
