Manohar S Rajputana,"Team, I installed Anaconda on Windows 10. I have included PATH as suggested. STRANGE ISSUE IS: When I open Jupyter Notebook from Anaconda prompt, it is opening fine. When I type the lower case in the line command, it always shows in upper case. I am not sure what is wrong. 

When I installed Anaconda in another partition with Ubuntu, it is working fine with no issues. Can any ANACONDA GURU please help me in fixing the Jupyter issue in Windows 10? Thank you in advance. (manohar20@yahoo.com - please send me the solution if you have to my email ID).",2,22/10/2018 07:53 PM
