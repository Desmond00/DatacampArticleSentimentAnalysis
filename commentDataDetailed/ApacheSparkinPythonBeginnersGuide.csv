Michael Zarate,"Do you have troubleshooting for when pyspark doesn't load in the terminal for ""Error while instantiating 'org.apach.spark.sql.hive.HiveSessionStateBuilder'"".

Also prebuilt packages from Spark don't require the step build/mvn -DskipTest clean package.",2,21/02/2018 01:58 AM
viktor,"Here, you would have to argue that Python has the main advantage if you’re talking about data science, as it provides the user with a lot of great tools for machine learning and natural language processing, such as SparkMLib.

Spark MLlib is not an advantage of Python. Do you mean scikit-learn?

Mind the spelling of MLlib",1,06/03/2018 03:53 PM

viewnaveen,"Thanks for this great article. Assume that you are receiving JSON 10 GB of multiple files for every 10 minutes from a Kafka cluster,  I want to know in a production environment, what processing steps like data cleansing, data acquisition, data enrichment, joining etc need to be done using python and what processing steps should be done with Spark? Also, if you can explain why some steps work well with python than spark or vice versa with a real time example, it helps a lot.",1,03/04/2018 08:32 PM
