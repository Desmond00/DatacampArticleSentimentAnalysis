pato lobos,"Hi Carlo,

Thanks for your tutorial.  How (assuming that you are using Windows) will you solve this code, without getting the maximum number of threads error? (OS limit in windows)

  

N <- 130

fvec <- vector(length=N, mode=""list"")

for (i in 1:N) {

 fname <- paste0(""C:/temp/foo"", i, "".tmp"")

 fvec[[i]] <- file(fname, ""w"")

}

Sys.sleep(3)

for (i in 1:N) {

 close(fvec[[i]])
