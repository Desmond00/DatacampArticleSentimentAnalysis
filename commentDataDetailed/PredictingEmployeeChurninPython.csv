Hernan Leon Herrera,"Dear Avinash, thanks for the tutorial... I'd like to know how to actually apply the model to employees that have not left the company; I believe that after the model has been trained one can call the gb.predict() passing the data set of the active employees ... in that case, how is the time variable applied? i.e. if an employee will leave what is the period of time that is considered? in the next 3 months, next 6 months, next year? 

Thanks again.",2,23/08/2018 03:41 PM

aim T,"Hi. thanks for the tutorial. it was really helpful. i tried using the same method on the data that was available with me(approx 35000 observation). and got these results:

Accuracy: 0.918102328802701

Precision: 0.0

Recall: 0.0

Precision is ill-defined and being set to 0.0 due to no predicted samples. 'precision', 'predicted', average, warn_for).

i am not able to understand why my precision and recall is 0??

also i want to know how to use and compare different models for prediction. please let me know how to proceed with this.

thanks",2,04/10/2018 05:50 PM

n m,"Hi Avinash,

Can you share a bit more about where the dataset comes from? If you created it can you tell me a bit more about how you decided the data you'd input? Thanks! I'm enjoying analyzing this but would like to know what I can say about it.
