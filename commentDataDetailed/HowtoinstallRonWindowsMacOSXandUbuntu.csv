Bob Bear,"Mauricio - good useful article. Thks!

Q:   what are those R commands
inside ""squiggly"" brackets? 

ie:   {r plot, warning = F}

Never seen them before
...what do they do?

Leon Hartman,"I have no idea how it works it what it's supposed to do, but Homebrew turned package installations in R Studio into an absolute nightmare for me.

Everything ran smoothly (and much much faster) after I uninstalled it.",1,31/08/2018 07:42 AM
Chuck Burks,"My biggest ""gottchas"" as a lone R user in an institutional Windows shop are: 1) Making R and RStudio work together when I usually don't have administrative privelages; and 2) making Git and Github work smoothly with RStudio (some influential bloggers convinced me that I should be using version control). I deal with the former by installing R in C:\R\ (e.g., C:\R\R-3.5.1) (as opposed to a default universal naming convention server location to which ""My Documents""  is re-routed) and by doing a lot of tweaking of .Rprofile and other settings files. I make sure that I do NOT obtain admin privelages when installing upgrading R, since I don't want to install in any subdirectory that I will not be able to access on a normal day-to-day basis. Git, Github, and version control are great when they work, but a bear when I have to figure out why it's not working. ",1,01/09/2018 04:15 AM
C Zhu,"For installing R on macOS, you recommend to compile using openblas for higher performance. ""I highly recommend to install R with OpenBLAS. In plain terms, OpenBLAS will boost some operations and I want you to be a happy user."" Can you back up your claim?

The default R binary installed by homebrew uses Apple implementation of BLAS i.e. Accelerate Framework. It's optmisied for the platform. The performance should be on par with or even slightly better than OpenBLAS.

While I haven't done a thorough test myself, it's my impression as well after trying R both with and without OpenBlas.

Ian Chong,Minor correction for the RStudio installation. In bold is an incorrect version number sudo apt-get install gdebi cd ~/Downloads wget https://download1.rstudio.org/rstudio-xenial-1.1.419-amd64.deb sudo gdebi rstudio-xenial-1.1.379-amd64.deb,2,12/11/2018 10:07 PM
Peng He,The last command of Step 3 for ubuntu was wrong. Please make sure you install exactly the version you downloaded.,1,21/12/2018 11:31 AM
Juan Pablo Ripamonti,"Hi Mauricio, thank you so much for this article. It was super useful. It is in my bookmarks now, ready to be shared with whoever might need it.

I followed it to install R Studio on Mac.  Everything seems to work well but unfortunately I get an error every time I open a terminal window as a result of adding the line below to the .bash_profile

Sys.setlocale(category=""LC_ALL"",locale=""en_US.UTF-8"")

The error message is the following:

-bash: /Users/juan/.bash_profile: line 4: syntax error near unexpected token `category=""LC_ALL"",locale=""en_US.UTF-8""'

-bash: /Users/juan/.bash_profile: line 4: `Sys.setlocale(category=""LC_ALL"",locale=""en_US.UTF-8"")'

I tried googling. I found that this same message sometimes show when copying and pasting code from a Windows machine or some other operative system, in which case they suggested to run dos2unix command to fix it. I tried this but it did not do the trick.

Do you happen to know what could be a solution for this? Is anyone else getting the same error?

Thanks a lot in advance!
