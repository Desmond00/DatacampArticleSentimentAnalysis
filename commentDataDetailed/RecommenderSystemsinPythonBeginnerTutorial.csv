Abbas Zahid,"I am not able to get pass through
tfidf_matrix.shape
out[] : (45466, 75827)
cosine_sim = cosine_similarity(tfidf_matrix,tfidf_matrix)
This cosine_sim give me an error:  array is too big; `arr.size * arr.dtype.itemsize` is larger than the maximum possible size.
Any idea whats wrong with this ?",2,21/03/2018 07:08 PM
Morgan Murphy,"This article was very helpful- thank you, Data Camp! I used the code to create a recommender for wines based on wine descriptions, so content-based all the way. I also included an option for a fuzzy wuzzy search since users would need to enter wine titles exactly, which is probably unlikely.  

I am trying to modify the code to have the model also bring back the similarity scores rather than just the title and index, but failing miserably. Could I  somehow append the cosine similarity matrix to the original dataframe and then modify the last line (return df['title'].iloc[wine_indices]) to the include similarity number? ",1,07/04/2018 12:42 AM

Zuriati Wenger,"Great tutorial.!

One question thou,  why did you not set the ngrams to be (1,2)?  For example. there are some genres that are classified as science fiction, which means the vectorizer will only count  1 for science and  1 for fiction, which when out of context, doesnt really make sense.  Perhaps there's a best practice? I am new to this, so I am just looking for some insights. Have been scouring  StackOverflow, but no one has really answered this question.

Thanks!",2,29/06/2018 03:30 PM

Nandan Pandya,This is a great article....I have build a recommender using the steps shown here. but i have an issue with key error as the search is case sensitive. What should i do make it run with any case i.e lower or upper. For ex. It gives me a key Error if i use 'the dark knight'. Please let me know your thoughts,1,13/05/2019 07:04 AM
