Shashikant Kumar,"I would like to just point one interesting and surprising casting example  of str data type with numerical value.

>>> x = 100.0

>>> print(int(x))

100

As expected, int() function converts floating point number to integer.

Guess what the following code will do :

x = '100.0'

print(int(x))




We will say (at least I said before writing this comment) it will print 100. 

But, but, but...

>>> x = '100.0'

>>> print(int(x))

Traceback (most recent call last):

  File ""<stdin>"", line 1, in <module>

ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '100.0'




Lastly, consider the following code:

x = '100.0'

print(float(x))




It works correctly.

>>> x = '100.0'

>>> print(float(x))

100.0




Why is Python designed this way? Well, I don't know. If any Python ""Guru"" wants to throw some light upon that please comment. 

Note:  Be careful while casting str data having numerical value.",2,03/06/2018 01:06 AM
Antoine Mercier,"Hey Sejal,




when you say:

""In a binary system, 10 is equal to 8 in octal. ""

....I think you mean:

""In an octal system, 10 is equal to 8 in decimal. ""

since: oct(8) == '0o10' evaluates to True




Thanks for the tutorial!",2,30/07/2018 02:59 AM

Zardosht Hodaie,Thanks for the nice article. Just a small side note: Python does not have a compiler. It has an interpreter. ,1,26/10/2018 05:13 PM
