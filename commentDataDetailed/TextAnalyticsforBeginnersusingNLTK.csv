Hugo Nicolau Barbosa de Gusmão,"Amazing tutorial!

I think you forgot to say that you need to use these commands:

nltk.download ('stopwords')

nltk.download ('punkt')",6,05/09/2018 08:08 PM

Lhicel Joyce Aytona,"Hi! If I want to use Sentiment Analysis on News Articles, how can I train my model if I will use data from a news website?  Of course my data will not have any target value or the y_train because it will come from raw news articles from the web unlike the built in data of movie reviews used in this tutorial which has x_train and y_train.

Can I use the same movie reviews data used in this tutorial to train my model and then use the news articles as a testing set for prediction? Or that will not work? Can I have your suggestion please? Thank you!",4,15/11/2018 10:41 AM
Charan gcp," Hi Avinash, this is a great tutorial. I appreciate you work on this to explain everything in a very well manner. I have a question: After I predict and get the accuracy lets say 60% I want to target the negative responses and take some action like further reach out to them and probe some questions. I should only target this 60% (which it accurately predicted and which contains the positive, negative and neutral sentiments I guess). can I identify who all fall under 60% and who all are under negative sentiment? your response is much appreciated Sir!! :) ",2,02/12/2018 01:27 AM

Nayana Sharma,"Great tutorial Avinash with nice step by step approach for Text Analytics. Have you considered using a different classifier instead of multinomial naive bayes? Perhaps, SGDClassifier may be? This is because of the obvious limitations of Naive Bayes i.e. the assumption of independent predictors. ",2,14/12/2018 02:22 AM

akshaya kumar,"Such a beautiful explanation. 

Could you please suggest what i should use for anomaly detection in application logs. There is no labeled data, so thinking it to be un-supervised text classification probably. 

Sample 2 lines of log:

2018-08-08 20:04:53.904 | INFO | [GeneratingProcessName] | APP_ID | USER_ID | GUID | PROCESS_DESC

2018-08-08 20:04:54.887 | ERROR | [GeneratingProcessName] | ERR_CODE | USER_ID | GUID | ERROR_DESC




ERROR_DESC and PROCESS_DESC are the fields with paragraph texts and that's the information we want to make use of. Of course nltk, tf-idf will be applied first on these columns. And rest all fields can be taken care of using LabelEncoding or OneHotEncoding.",1,15/05/2019 08:17 PM
