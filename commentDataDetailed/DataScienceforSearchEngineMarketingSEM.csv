Rafi MOHAMMED,"Instead of having for loop twice.

I feel its better to do it once., as best practice to avoid redundancy of code.

Eg: keyword = '+' + ' +'.join([instructor.replace(' ', ' +').lower(), word])

         keyword1 = '+' + ' +'.join([word, instructor.replace(' ', ' +').lower()])

 --------------------------------------------------------------------

            keyword = instructor.lower() + ' ' + word

                keyword1 = word + ' ' + instructor.lower()

---------------------------------------------------------------------

instructor_keywords.append(row)            

            instructor_keywords1.append(row1)

instructor_keywords.extend(instructor_keywords1)
