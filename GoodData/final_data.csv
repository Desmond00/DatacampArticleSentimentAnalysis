Datasets used for this tutorial?
can anyone explain me these lines of code
"Why not build basic models using other features like its done with the survived column  spit over the gender column( i.e . all the women survived and men didn't ) . Maybe other features would give better accuracy before starting with machine learning . for example : PC class shows that passengers who traveled in first class were more likely to survive so we could build a model that all 1st class passengers survived and  rest didn't , similarly with other features ."
Thanks Hugo for the great tutorial!

I even think Conda envoronments surpass standard virtual environments. At least, when I install or update packages via Conda environment manager, it also updates other packages, so all the packages within the Conda environment are consistent. "

"HI Thushan,   "
Hello.
"this tutorial doesn;'t work i have error at :
 "
As someone who has been developing for a few years but is pretty new to python I've found this work to be very insightful and well explained! Oddly enough the only thing I can't figure out is how to read the graph at the very end.  Would you be able to explain what the lines creating the graph are doing?  
Thanks for sharing your idea and code.
"Hey I have to make a comment here: your explanation after LSTM section is kinda a mess and I don't think people can follow you and your code (as complained by others in the comment section). And I found the reference repository you listed did a way better job explaining the process and the result! Even the code using Keras is way simpler and easier to follow. I don't know what you're trying to say about the final visualization, did you even describe what the graph is?"
Great tutorial and I found it very informative.
"Hi Thushan,"

"Why normalize the Data using different arbitrary batches?

How can i adjust the LSTM parameters to make it only predict one step ahead so I can compare it to other models directly in that capacity? I've tried setting n_predict_once = 1 and/or num_unrollings but the MSE results are discouraging by comparison.
"Hi , Thank you so much for your tutorial. "
any one this method ues in django website?
 Hi Thushan:
"Hello sir I have one doubt that in this example u have taken 3 hidden layers, but if I want to increase the layers into 20 then how to code that.  I will be thankful if u answer this "
Thank you.
"Hi Sir !
Thank you for your tutorial

I have some doubt that maybe you can clear out.

Firstly, after I read your explanation, I though the code will predict the 50 steps ahead of time.
But, I think your code is in the end just predicting a one step-ahead.

Your num_unrolling is how many steps back you run to get info from training data, to predict the one step ahead thing.
From there you run prediction to the future for n_predict_once times.
At this point, maybe this is what you mean by predicting 50 steps ahead, because n_predict_once is 50
But, if it work that way, then your prediction is hardly to even reach 50% accuracy.
Since we predict n_predict_once ahead, then I should observe only the tail from the red line, which is the 50th prediction ahead.
This value is in the end the 50th steps ahead prediction which we want.

So, if we compare the tail of each red line with the real price movement.
There are many times, where the red tail is going down while the price movement is up, and so the opposite.

In short, I wonder, what exactly you mean by ""able to predict stock price behavior correctly most of the time"" ?
Because it was not so.
Am I missing something ?

"Hi Debbie, "
"Thanks for all your posts in this series Debbie, it's been some really interesting material and tutorials to go through. I had a quick question for you going back to Part 1. I'm a Masters student in the field and due to my love of music I'm considering doing my final capstone project on the evolution of Pop music through the decades using a lot of techniques I've learned in your tutorials. However, building the dataset of songs and lyrics through web scraping and cleaning isn't something I'm familiar with. Is this any chance you'd be able to share your code and/or workflow on how you created the original dataset so I could learn from that?"
nice information on data science has given thank you very much.
"One of the best in-depth tutorial I've followed through in a while. I've been learning about Machine Learning and R for a few months now, but articles like yours make me realize how much more there is for me to know, also builds more respect for all you data scientists. Big thanks to you Debbie. "

thanx for clearing the air on tuples in a simple yet effective tutorial.
Thanks
"Hello, nice tutorial, but the definition of any for tuples is wrong.
any will return True when at least one of the elements is Truthy.
Therefore your example above:  a=(1,), any(a) will return True.  "
Thanks 
You should add a section on 'named' tuples as they are the most useful manifestation of tuples in real-life application in my opinion
Great article. Thanks!
"The following example code prints ""True"" not ""False"" as shown above."

Any further help in terms implementing in code would be appreciate. Thanks."

I felt, these 3 steps could have been explained for the major architectures like R-CNN, Faster R-CNN, R-FCN and then SSD and YOLO.

"I have no idea how it works it what it's supposed to do, but Homebrew turned package installations in R Studio into an absolute nightmare for me."
"My biggest ""gottchas"" as a lone R user in an institutional Windows shop are: 1) Making R and RStudio work together when I usually don't have administrative privelages; and 2) making Git and Github work smoothly with RStudio (some influential bloggers convinced me that I should be using version control). I deal with the former by installing R in C:\R\ (e.g., C:\R\R-3.5.1) (as opposed to a default universal naming convention server location to which ""My Documents""  is re-routed) and by doing a lot of tweaking of .Rprofile and other settings files. I make sure that I do NOT obtain admin privelages when installing upgrading R, since I don't want to install in any subdirectory that I will not be able to access on a normal day-to-day basis. Git, Github, and version control are great when they work, but a bear when I have to figure out why it's not working. "
"For installing R on macOS, you recommend to compile using openblas for higher performance. ""I highly recommend to install R with OpenBLAS. In plain terms, OpenBLAS will boost some operations and I want you to be a happy user."" Can you back up your claim?"
Minor correction for the RStudio installation. In bold is an incorrect version number sudo apt-get install gdebi cd ~/Downloads wget https://download1.rstudio.org/rstudio-xenial-1.1.419-amd64.deb sudo gdebi rstudio-xenial-1.1.379-amd64.deb

Nice Explanation. 
Nice explanation.  I find the main challenge with reinforcement learning is converting the problem into an agent-environment to solve. Every explanation I have read is usually on how to solve a pre-defined problem but not on how to define the problem. How would you recommend approach designing the environment (other than already pre-made ones) and any resources I can use to help with this ? 
Hey Anubhav! Your explanation was very good. I was initially thinking to go with very big frameworks like TF or sklearn. Then I later stumbled upon your article and I liked it very much.

Very easy to understand.  Well done.  Thank you!
Another cheat sheet link: https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/survminer.pdf
"Many thanks for your work. The best approach for the beginner is to understand that statistical methods performed on data will   not only reveal quirky data  that should be overlooked, but also data needed to construct the model.  The model can reveal further insight into the analysis  that will solve a problem and also lead to another form of model that helps the data scientist get further insight. When the predictions  become accurate a significant amount of the time, then the frequency of the data reveal in some histogram will establish a solid evaluative feedback. That feedback can be the baseline for future data analysis on similar data-frames. The sum of the parts could be greater than the whole, but the model derived from the statistics turns clusters into informative graphical charts. "
"Are you sure `fustat` means ""censored or not""? If so, then it is the opposite of ""event"". But when you call `Surv()` you have `event = ovarian.fustat`; shouldn't it be `event = 1 - ovarian.fustat` ? (I cannot type `$` here so I replaced it with `.`)"

Why do you dichotomize the age variable into age_group? Could continuous variables be included for Cox Proportional Hazard models?
"Hi, great stuff ! Very clear, instructive, and efficient.
One remark though : I ve been curious about the time unit of the futime variable... and none of you guys talk about it ! Even the help('ovarian') doesn't precise what this variable is counting.
Ooops ?

I assumed it is a count of days and it may be obvious for survival pros, but pros or not, any graph or table HAS TO GIVE NUMBERS AND THEIR UNITS ;)"

"Hey,  how can you choose 4 features to select ? In case of a large dataset of more than 100 features, I don't think so It would be a great thing to randomly select the number of features to get selected. Can you explain any other process to handle this thing. It would be  a great help.  "

why Do we retrain the model with all layers as trainable? 
Autoencoders comes under unsupervised learning while training we don't give labels but in  the code you have given labels also.  We will train our network to get the decoded output as our original image. I hope i will get the Answer.
Such an amazing tutorial. Thank you Aditya :) 
"Hi, I copied your code and ran it. However, I found out the classification accuracy does not change no matter layer.trainable = False or True. You said the validation accuracy can go up to 99% when set layer.trainable =False. But it never happen for me. Could you let me know what details should I focus on? Thank you very much! Your tutorial help me very much! "
"I think I got it now. In the first step, we set layer.trainable=False to train fully connected layer, then we set layer.trainable=True to train whole model. The second step as ""fine tune"". That is why when we set False, the validation acc is ~91% and ~92% when we set true. If we do not use weights from auto encoder model, it will have slow convergence compared with using auto encoder information. Am I right?"
Thank for your great post.

Great points raised in this article.  I agree that python is the absolute easiest way to to analyze data. Tableau is good contender that I very rarely hear brought up.  Personally I prefer R for data analysis but python is definitely easier to use than R. 
I am an Excel power user and learning to code Python on datacamp! I'd love to combine the two!  
Awesome tutorial with lots of useful information. Thanks Jason Graham.
The points have been laid down and explained really well. Kudos!
You have put it together so excellently. I am exploring the abilities of Pandas myself. It has been an amazing journey so far.
"I need to create and manage data collection & analysis tools that other people use. Given the fact (which you mention in an above comment) that far more people are familiar with Excel than with Python or Jupyter, how would you recommend setting up a workflow? Keep data entry in Excel, but transition analysis, visualization, and reporting to Jupyter? That way, most people don't need to learn a new software, and a few people trained in Python can maintain the analysis side of things. Regardless, this article is certainly an inspiration to improve our workflow, despite currently being so reliant on Excel!!"
"This is a very relevant article for me. I fell in love with python language when i was first introduced to it by a collegue and since started using my weekends to learn python, pandas etc here on Datacamp. Im an experienced user of Excel vba and i had some procedures which incoming goal seek and loops set up in Excel vba which i tried to replicate in python but i failed badly. There was no way to create a goal seek procedure in python and after several tries I reverted back to excel. Especially one of the procedures with goal seek was so important for my work so I couldn’t see myself working with python. If i someday meet some skilled python programmer I will ask that person to help me create a goal seek procedure until then I am stuck with excel. :("
Excellent article. I love how pandas reduces the number of lines of code needed to do many things. I love the data visualization aspect and learning everyday to be better at python and pandas.
"There are many points in this article where I perk up, crack a huge smile on my face and then take a deep sigh, because there are so (so so) many things I can relate to. "
"I strongly agree with you on several points. I myself is an advanced Excel user but after spending lots of time with Python and R, I became hooked and switched completely from Excel. Python and R is the absolute go to when it comes to data analysis and data science as a whole."

Hi...
Great article thank you. 
Very good tutorial! Intuitive and practical lessons!
"Nice and easy introductory tutorial, very good for beginners like me."
"Great Article! This was a really comprehensive, detailed, and helpful tutorial, especially as an introduction to machine learning. I was wondering, when choosing the k-value for optimization, why did you not use k=9? Based on my graph, k=9 seems to exhibit most accurate results, and when I run the algorithm with k=9 upon the test-set, it exhibits 100% accuracy. Is it because both test_accuracy=training_accuracy when k=3?"
"Hi Team,"
Thanks for the explanation. I wonder if you have a github related to this post ?
Thanks Karlijn for the write up. I am not strong in maths and so had some doubt if i will succeed doing this but i now have the edge to go on. I will take it one day at a time

"Thank you so much Karlijn! It's good to hear that people in the field come from different backgrounds and not just tech! Also, thank you for the infographic, it's very helpful!"
"Please,  is there any certification for this course? "
"Thanks Karlijn, appreciate the article.  One question though, I'm taking the Data Science track in Python with DataCamp and obviously it has a few Statistical Thinking in Python courses.  Wondering if you think (as I really do not have much of a math background) that I would be better supplementing my learning with your suggestions?  Thanks again."
"Hi there,"
"Thanks for this post.  Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from data in various forms, both structured and unstructured, similar to data mining .  hotmail customer service has the details of data mining."
"Thanks for post.  This is a very computer science centric view.  A big, big gap here that will make the difference in your career is knowing about business, how it works etc. , what your employers need and problem construction and reframing it is probably harder than any Languages you'll learn.  Being able to translate your results succinctly and in an easy format should be on this list. "

"Great read. I've used decision trees a few times for classification problems. The greatest strength of the trees is their readability, in comparison to other models. However, the biggest problem I've run into is trying to train decision trees using datasets with lots of categorical data. Is there any way to better train trees on datasets with lots of string data (eg: country/company names)?"
This is a great article - I like the content a lot - well done. I have one quick question. Isn't it the test error in this case that is at 26 and the oob that is at 20 with 1 tree? The way I read the article it seems flipped.
"Awesome, however i got an error  while using the text function. this is the error."
"after the step of evaluate the error  by using a misclassification table, shouldn't the error rate be 0.24? the 0.76 would be the accuracy?"

" Hi Avinash, this is a great tutorial. I appreciate you work on this to explain everything in a very well manner. I have a question: After I predict and get the accuracy lets say 60% I want to target the negative responses and take some action like further reach out to them and probe some questions. I should only target this 60% (which it accurately predicted and which contains the positive, negative and neutral sentiments I guess). can I identify who all fall under 60% and who all are under negative sentiment? your response is much appreciated Sir!! :) "
Very informative.  Thanks for posting . 
"Great tutorial Avinash with nice step by step approach for Text Analytics. Have you considered using a different classifier instead of multinomial naive bayes? Perhaps, SGDClassifier may be? This is because of the obvious limitations of Naive Bayes i.e. the assumption of independent predictors. "

"Initially I thought this tutorial was good, but its not...At first we will do the analysis part and found that petal's dimensions are highly correlated. Then we will throw those findings and divide the dataset and give them to classifier. Then why did EDA on that set?"
I think there's a mistake in one of your solutions. When setting the training and test sets you used the iris and not the iris_norm dataframe. I think the point was to use the normalized data?
"Another small mistake. When you're merging the labels, you don't actually merge the datafreme irisTestLables, but you merge the factor iris.testLables"
A very clear and useful tutorial!

"I read a lot about splitting data into train, test and validation split (60:20:20). Why do you estimate here with k-fold cross validation on the whole data and why don't you just estimate it on training data? I thought that first, you  should estimate it on training data, then check results and calibrate on validating data and this all try on testing data.... Thank you for your answer"

If yes, then I can just make a Java API where I can load the model and then I don't have to create a python environment. thanks in advance"

"The comments on np.hsplit and np.vsplit are not very correct. As the second arguments are 2, my_stacked_array will be split into two sections of equal sizes. It will be split at the 2nd index if the second argument is [2]."
"I have not gone far with this tutorial but I have searched for the best, this is what I found"
"Thank you for this fantastic tutorial. With your permission, I would like to provide my students a link to this page, so that they have a good understanding of Numpy Arrays."
thanks allot its very  Nice tutorial   
"There is a bit of correction to be made in this tutorial in the part regarding splitting of arrays. In both  np.hsplit() and np.vsplit(), the second argument is in fact not the index at which to split the array, but rather the equal number of parts in which the array must be split. This means we can't just supply any arbitrary number as the second argument...it depends upon the shape of our array. In this case my_stacked_array has shape (2,8) which means it can be split horizontally into two arrays of equal shape (2,4) each or it can be split vertically into two arrays of equal shape (1,8) each. This wasn't explained in the tutorial and I felt it important to highlight."

Much obliged for sharing your considerations and thoughts on this one. It would be ideal if you continue posting about such articles as they truly spread helpful data about http://www.assignmentcorner.co.uk/assignment-writing-service post on low value constrained possibility.
great  article! Can  we  bookmark or save it?
"hello ,every one i nweed help in the tokenization of amharic text which is non english character that have pancutation marks not recogized in    english ."
hello sir 
Great tutorial. In fact its the first google search result for difference between stemming and lemmatization.
"Did anyone read this after it was written? The tutorial would have been good if it was not absolutely riddled with spelling mistakes and English language mistakes. If the tutorial was initially written in another language and then machine translation was used to generate the English version, then kudos but otherwise, please, someone, fix the language. "
What about the datasets used in this notebook?
Where will get train and test dataset's ?
"Thank you, master Hugo for the amazing tutorial,"
Excellent tutorial! Learned a ton and explanation is understandable for someone new to machine learning.
I am very unclear on the section 
In the following section: 
Was following : randomized_pca = RandomizedPCA(n_components=2)
A jupyter notebook of the same can help!
@Karlijn Willems : 
" As your use case was one for clustering, you can follow the path on the map towards “KMeans”. You’ll see the use case that you have just thought about requires you to have more than 50 samples (“check!”), to have labeled data (“check!”), to know the number of categories that you want to predict (“check!”) and to have less than 10K samples (“check!”). "
" You’ll see that the training set X_train now contains 1347 samples, which is exactly 2/3d of the samples that the original data set contained, and 64 features, which hasn’t changed. The y_traintraining set also contains 2/3d of the labels of the original data set. This means that the test sets X_test and y_test contain 450 samples. "
"The link to the kaggle website in the third para of the section at the top ""Loading your dataset"" is incorrect."
Very Nicely explained steps
I think the train test split you used is 3/4 and I/4 respectively since test_size = 0.25.
didn't understand the meaning of target an keys attribute ? 
very nicely written. thank you so much to share this .
Very bad explained ...     :(
"very nice article has been shared about data science thank you. <a href=""https://aditidigitalsolutions.com/data-science-training-hyderabad?ref=gmb/"">Data Science Training in Hyderabad</a>"

randomized_pca = RandomizedPCA(n_components=2)
"Hey Karlijn, great tutorial! Had one question though, I'm really confused on why you would want to use k-fold Cross Validation.  Why are we taking the average of the different models - as far as I see these models are working completely independently of each other. Are we meant to average the weights of the individual models to get a better result? Thanks in advance, Adrian."
Good tutorial . Thank you 
very good tutorial
This is great stuff! Honestly it is really helpful!
Great tutorial! is  'treshold'  a typo of the word 'threshold' ?
awesome explanation.
Been searching for an intuitive tutorial which is not based on MNIST or image data.. Thanks for this !
"Nice tutorial, thanks!"
Really awesome program. But I face a problem when run line
"Thanks for the tutorial! Really nice walk through. However, one bit of intuition I'm missing is how to choose the number of hidden units. In the first model, the input layer had a size of 12 and the second layer had 8 hidden units. The second model had 64 and you suggest increasing it to 128 as a possible way to improve the model. Do they need to be multiples of 8? I don't see any other connection. Any guidance would be great. Thanks!"
"There's a typo. Here the model takes in input of (11,) in the first dense layer, not (12,) like mentioned in the paragraph. "
Tks for Share! Realy nice how you explain complex themes in the easy way!!! 
"Hello Karlijn,
 "
how can we do the preprocessing with tensorflow
Please fix link to wine data set
"I believe you want to link the text ""wine quality data set"" under to heading ""Predicting Wine Types: Red or White?"" to https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality rather than this page itself (https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/deep-learning-python)."
"Karlijn, thank you very much for your sharing this great tutorial, I have two questions, could you please help?"
I got an error when trying to run the confusion matrix:
"Great tutorial, I've read through tons, and this is by far the best one I've seen yet.  I actually have it bookmarked. "
"y_pred array in confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred) expecting 0s or 1s.  So I used   y_pred = y_pred >= 0.13 to make 0s or 1s. But confusion matrix  gave the result   array([[1564,   24],"
Thanks for sharing this information. You give a depth knowledge about Python.
Hi madam well explained..
thanks for this detailed guide. Terraria ios free download good work. 
Very nice post. It could use an editor’s touch though. 
"it's very useful,thaks a lot!"
Awesome!
Thank you
"On MacOS 10.14.2. (""Mojave""), the  MySQL connector downloaded from mysql.com according to your link (""mysql-connector-python-8.0.13-macos10.14.dmg""), will not install. The error message says that the version of the driver is not compatible with this version of the OS. Any suggestions? Txs."
"why I have the problem? ""Authentication plugin 'caching_sha2_password' is not supported"", as I try to connect to mysql with python"
"It's helpful, thanks."
"This tutorial is well-written. However,  I feel Oracle's MySQL tutorial seems better. One thing is that these examples does not show that you need to close the cursor and disconnect the connection. Beginners usually try out examples verbatim,  so these examples would cause one to open multiple connections to the database. Also the data fetched from the database could be large, so using fetchall() before iteration over the elements in the results seems inefficient and not idiomatic at least."
"Avinash,"
Please send me message @blessedkome2@gmail.
"Hello Avinash,
First of all : thank you for this tutorial very accurate and receptive!
Then, I have a question : once you have got the feature importances, it could good to know in which way those features affect the target.
To be more clear a little ex : ""more the petal with is great, more the iris could be a setosa"".

Do you think, it's relevant to use a linear model (ex : logistic regression) to define that?
"
Can you please put some light on now to train with missing values rather than imputing with mean values
very good article for the beginners in machine learning. very well explained.
"Nice tutorial, thank you."
"Hi!
When I try "
i want random forest code in R 
I need to build a model to find credit risk of a customer. My dataset contains 1000 rows out of which only 30 rows are having credit risk as 0 while other 970 has value as 1. So now my question is do i need to do anything in data preprocessing since data is more biased towards one side.. anyone can help?
Hello i want random forest code in Python for crop prediction pls help me 
thank you so much all the way from Yemen
      
how to customize the distance between x-axis and the sub-title (not xlab) on the x-axis in R programme. 
"when I try to execute code that employs the ggplot function, I've continuously failed to generate a plot (a blank graph is all that appears). Am I doing something wrong? "
"How we can remove sub ticks and labels in a biplot? should we use xaxt.sub= 'n', yaxt.sub='n'"
I am facing one problem in coding. Any thoughts or suggestions are welcome.
"Regarding X-Axis values, I have nine histograms that are stacked in one column. All have the same value range for the X-Axis. How do I tell R to remove the values for the upper eight graphs and leave the values for the bottom graph only? I want to keep the X-Axis with tick marks for the upper eight, but remove the values that are associated with them to open up the spacing "
bokeh.charts is no longer supported! 
Those guidelines additionally worked to become a good way to recognize that other people online have the identical fervor like mine to grasp great deal more around this condition.
 The .ix indexer is deprecated  starting in Pandas 0.20.0.
 I've been searching for some relevant information on feature engineering. Is there a full guide with the  examples to try? I've also sent a request to hire essay writers on training courses. The application will be reviewed only after the submission is closed. Their Python courses and guides are now only pre-paid. 
Thanks for your useful article :)
Thanks for your work
Good job
Awesome 
Very good content! Thanks
It was very informative as I’ve always wanted to explore GUI in python but didn’t know how
"Hello!
I'm only familiar with the basics of python , so my question is ; is that enough to dive in to this tutorial or I should work more on my skills regarding python ?!"
GREAT Informations
"Wow, this is an AMAZING tutorial! Thank you so much!"
"Nice job, thank's!"
First of all this is amazing tutorial. Thanks
i have error in my code for mouse clicking event topic 
My question is how to add a label on a image in python
how to insert an image in the top right corner of the window in grid layout
"In the Classes chapter, there are some errors in __init__ function and say_hi function. You'll need to put self.window = window in __init__ function and call self.window instead of window at the tkinter.Label in the say_hi function."
What is the code editor you're using?
"Hi , I'm using Python 3.7.1 and when I tried the example from the paragraph 11. Alert Box , particularly  this  piece  of code:"
In calculator program  what is the use of lambda. Why it is not working is the function is a normal function(not lambda function)
"Perfect article! Clear, simple and concise"
   
Very informative and well illustrated.
"Quite an informative read aditya, and I must say very well articulated with apt graphical representations wherever needed"
Thank you! Very Helpful!!
"i think there should be a faster and easier way to create vectors in python, no? for instance if you receive a list of numbers that you can then convert using np.array like so : new_vector= np.array(list(range(10))  but i am guessing there should be other ways to make this happen fast instead of typing each number inside square brackets one by one? "

"Hi Debbie, an amazing job!!. Thank you for share it :)"
Wow. I will try it for sure.
"Debbie, what a thorough analysis on Prince's song lyrics.  You touch on every academic aspect required to validate an analysis such as this one.  I will soon take an approach at sentiment analysis on memorable speeches using the shared knowledge you have shown on this post. KUDOS!!!"
You could not have chosen a cooler subject matter!!!  Kudos! ;-)
"Where can we download the ""prince_data.csv"" file?"
This was a very good analisys.
"RE: my understanding is that  LDA is a form of supervised learning since  groups are known a priori .  See  graphic for ""Tools used in this study""  etc"
amazing work :)  is airlines review data-set can suite for this tidy analysis  ??  is tidy is perfect or good for sentiment analysis . 
There was a question as to where the source files are located. Here is the link. Please let me know if there are any problems.   https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/blog_assets/sentiment_analysis/princeEvents.csv 
Wow - really awesome work! Do you already know when we can expect part 2B to be released :)? I am looking forward!
"Although I'm not sure of the publication date for Part 2B, it's hopefully targeted for the end of this month or beginning of next (dependent upon DC's release schedule as well). I will keep everyone updated in the comments here. Please check back! Thanks!"
"Hi Debbie, Superb tutorial on Sentimental Analysis. You have shown very nicely usage of R, NLP , dplyr , Data Visualization etc"
"Thanks Debbie, I've continued my analysis of The Smiths following your tutorials. They don't have such a big catalogue so can't be quite as in depth but a very useful learning exercise. "
Interesting article. Loved the example of analysis using lyrics...
"Dear Debbie, "
"Sorry, i realize my previous question was posted on the wrong page."
"@ashy Grace, Yes! There is a sentiment lexicon in the tidytext package called ""loughran"" that is specific to the financial domain, so replace ""bing"" or ""nrc"" with ""loughran"". See this link for more detailed information: https://bit.ly/2K4OCyM"
Here is the link to Part 2B!

"Hi, Debbie.  Excellent article!  I once again used your techniques on the lyrics of Bob Dylan: http://rpubs.com/paul_reiners/dylan_sentiment_analysis"
"yes, Paul Reiners :-)"
So glad I found this tutorial. It taught me so much. I have gone through a few other tutorials but this one brought it all together in a fun way.  Thanks!!
Hi and thank you for this awesome tutorial! Question: I get the following message for the last code block for pairwise correlation:
"This is a very helpful post and I have used it to do my own sentiment analysis of and internal survey. I am have been able to run all the graphs with my own data except the pairwise comparisons and correlations.I am able to get the graphs but the x-axis aren't making sense. For example my pairwise correlations for the word ""improve"" has all 7 words showing nearly 100% correlation. When I initially create the pwc dataset I get the following message: "
Where is part two and three? thank you
