## Notes taken while doing the labelling
- I have not treated encouragements like "Hey Sayak, great article. Thank you" as spam. However. If a comment is like "Hey Sayak!", it really does not convey anything other than a salutation. So, comments like these have been marked as spam.
- There are many comments which portray marketing contents. They have been treated as spams. Example: 
  > I believe you have used Microsoft Excel on some occasion. It is very powerful when it comes to working with spreadsheets, tables, charts, etc. But what does Python have to do with that?  epson error code 0x10",Python Excel Tutorial: The Definitive Guide
- To incorporate a bit of context in the righteous labelling, we included article names too. 
- There can be some amount of indirect bias in the labels. For this, we will have to either take help of a linguist expert or o more experienced Data Scientist who has worked with manual labelling before.
- There were hyperlinks included in the words in many comments. We did not separately scrapped them. 
- Other than English languages have been considered as spam.
- Single words in comments has been considered as spam.
