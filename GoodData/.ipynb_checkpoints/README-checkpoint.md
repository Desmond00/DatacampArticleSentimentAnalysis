## Notes taken while doing the labelling
- I have not treated encouragements like "Hey Sayak, great article. Thank you" as spam. However. If a comment is like "Hey Sayak!", it really does not convey anything other than a salutation. So, comments like these have been marked as spam.
- There are many comments which portray marketing contents. They have been treated as spams. 
- Since only the comments are being used for labelling, their relevance for an article or a tutorial have not been considered. Future work may be :)
- There can be some amount of indirect bias in the labels. For this, we will have to either take help of a linguist expert or o more experienced Data Scientist who has worked with manual labelling before.
