"Thanks for this tutorial! I am trying to use it to generate a wordcloud with a csv file dumped from a support ticketing system's database. The system dumps a plain text utf-8 csv. I'm able to load the dataframe if I use:

df = pd.read_csv(""data/test.csv"")

However if I use:

df = pd.read_csv(""data/test.csv"", index_col=0)

Or if I use:

df = pd.read_csv(""data/test.csv"", index_col=TicketID)

I get an error: ""KeyError = 0""

If I simply remove the index_col=0, the dataframe loads. All good... Until I get to the next steps...

When I try and join all the fields in column ""Title"" (or any other column) with:

text = "" "".join(review for review in df.Title)

print (""There are {} words in the combination of all review."".format(len(text)))

I get the following error:

TypeError: sequence item 556: expected str instance, float found

Any ideas on what could be causing these errors?  Perhpas some strange characters in the csv? Is there a directive to treat everything as a string?

"Hi Sejal!

Great Tutorial:) 

I need some guidance, I am working on a project for a client, well not really working but it's part of my master's curriculum. The data set are real world data.  I have bunch of ordinal categorial variables (~20) as inputs and now I would need to cluster them to create market segmentation. These variables are actually scaled variables i.e. on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 being the lowest and 5 the highest range on that scale. While designing the survey questionnaire, we had ensured to maintained the uniformity i.e. all these ordinal categorical variables have fixed scale i.e. 1 to 5 to avoid any false positives and less data transformation. In short, each question is framed to address different aspects of consumer buying behaviors in short.

Now, I am trying to explore ways where I can form clusters using these variables. I also have their demographics data(Age,Gender, Income, Education, etc.,). I have never worked on ordinal categorical variables to create cluster as my understanding is limited to numerical/continuous variables only as k-means works really well based on euclidean distance principle.

Could you please suggest a way to work on this?

Appreciate your help!

Thanks!

"Hi, 

First of all, thanks for the article, its very interesting and the example is well explained. 

I'm not very familiarized with the NYC boroughs, but looking at some maps and at your example, I don't know if I'm understanding it well. 

I think that with k-means,  your are dividing your data (latitude and longitude) into 5 different groups. But this groups calculated by k-means, really don't match with the boroughs, do they?

I guess you are assuming that they are similar enough to the boroughs to assume each one of this calculated groups represent a borough? For instance Queens, in the map representation it is identified with the purple dots, but looking at a NYC map, this area looks more like Brooklyn than Queens.

There is one aspect I don't understand though:  the article suggests that the clustering is 'impressive' because it maps on to the real world boundaries, to some extent. This doesn't seem to me to be the measure of success (and I see in response to another question the author does say that any similarity is actually incidental). 

Wouldn't it be more interesting if the algorithm showed clusters that bore no resemblance at all to geographical boundaries, and isn't this more the purpose of the clustering (ie to uncover groupings that we weren't already aware of in the data)?",,K-Means Clustering in R Tutorial

"Hi,

I was wondering if you could provide an explanation or interpretation of the visualizations. How would someone less familiar with these models explain what is being portrayed in the first versus second graph and what the red versus blue lines mean, particularly from a ""business"" perspective? 

Also, thank you for posting this tutorial. The only bug I found was with ""maintaining LSTM state for the prediction stage"" section. I added the last line to avoid issues with reuse of variables. I received an error re. variable scope without the last line below:




for li in range(n_layers):
   sample_c.append(tf.Variable(tf.zeros([1, num_nodes[li]]), trainable=False))
   sample_h.append(tf.Variable(tf.zeros([1, num_nodes[li]]), trainable=False))
   initial_sample_state.append(tf.contrib.rnn.LSTMStateTuple(sample_c[li],sample_h[li]))
   tf.get_variable_scope().reuse_variables()",,Stock Market Predictions with LSTM in Python
"Could you please explain what all these variable are?


def __init__(self,prices,batch_size,num_unroll):

         self._prices = prices

         self._prices_length = len(self._prices) - num_unroll

         self._batch_size = batch_size

         self._num_unroll = num_unroll

         self._segments = self._prices_length //self._batch_size


I'm guessing prices is the total number of price entries
Not sure what price_length is. I thought maybe it's number of prices per batch, but it doesn't look like it... Like if you have a set [1,2,3,4,5] with batch size = 2, then you have 4 batches, each with two elements. Where you get the number of batches from (num of prices - num of prices per batch + 1)
Isn't num_unroll just the number of batches? At least that's what it looks like from the example. But then you also have segments, which is what?


Also, where is it predicting the future price exactly? The graphs seem to just show the current days' prices. Unless it's just plotted a day back.

And lastly, how do I get back the original prices? I tried doing inverse_transform but it didn't quite work.

"As someone who has been developing for a few years but is pretty new to python I've found this work to be very insightful and well explained! Oddly enough the only thing I can't figure out is how to read the graph at the very end.  Would you be able to explain what the lines creating the graph are doing?  

For example the last red line in the Best Predictions overtime graph starts at a high and dips down mirroring the actual price movement direction. Do I interpret that as it knew there was going to be a drop but not necessarily what the price would be? Lastly after point 12,000 there are no red lines. Is that because they weren't graphed or they overlap so well with the blue lines that we just don't visually see them?

"Hi Sir !
Thank you for your tutorial

I have some doubt that maybe you can clear out.

Firstly, after I read your explanation, I though the code will predict the 50 steps ahead of time.
But, I think your code is in the end just predicting a one step-ahead.

Your num_unrolling is how many steps back you run to get info from training data, to predict the one step ahead thing.
From there you run prediction to the future for n_predict_once times.
At this point, maybe this is what you mean by predicting 50 steps ahead, because n_predict_once is 50
But, if it work that way, then your prediction is hardly to even reach 50% accuracy.
Since we predict n_predict_once ahead, then I should observe only the tail from the red line, which is the 50th prediction ahead.
This value is in the end the 50th steps ahead prediction which we want.

So, if we compare the tail of each red line with the real price movement.
There are many times, where the red tail is going down while the price movement is up, and so the opposite.

In short, I wonder, what exactly you mean by ""able to predict stock price behavior correctly most of the time"" ?
Because it was not so.
Am I missing something ?

"Thanks for the write up. I have been working on time series prediction for around year now,.

I have some questions in your current implementation:


When you have compared the results noted as predicted and actual data in the graphs, was true data given as input for the future predictions? I mean for the future predictions, as you are doing single step prediction, say to predict values of a day after tomorrow I will have to have tomorrow's data (assuming each time step interval is a day), but in practice we don't really have the true data of tomorrow, though we can obviously use predictions of tomorrow from the today's data but there would be some error in it, which dramatically increases as we go farther in the future to predict. Though multi step predictions work better but are not as good as when we do predictions based on true data, also results are not really robust and are very much depend upon the step size. ",,Stock Market Predictions with LSTM in Python

1D Linear Loss Function Plots. One simple and lightweight method to plot loss function is to choose two sets of parameters θi and θf , and plot the values of the loss function L(θ) along the line connecting these two sets. We can parameterize this line by choosing a scalar parameter α and defining the weighted average θα = (1 − α)θi + αθf , and compute the function f(θ) = L(θα). Here we choose θi as the randomly assigned initial weights and θf the final well-trained model weights in Part (1) above (global minimum, hopefully).

To calculate the loss function, we fed a predetermined test or training dataset (which should be consistent for the whole process of loss function evaluation) to the model determined by θα and compute the loss function. With sufficient (α,f(α)) points, we can display the loss function in 1D space.

(b). 2D Loss Contour Plots. In this approach, one first chooses a parameter set θ∗, which can be the final parameter set θf , to be used as the reference center of the 2D loss plot to be generated, and then chooses two direction vectors,δ and η (with dimensions compatible with θ). One then plots a function of the form f(α, β) = L(θ∗ + αδ + βη).

in the (α,β) 2D (surface) space. α and β are real scalars. δ and η could be two randomly generated vectors (with proper normalization (see Notes below). This approach was used to explore the trajectories of different minimization methods. Again, θ∗ could be the final well-trained model weights from Part (1). Similar to Part 2(a), we can show the 2D loss landscape.




Could you suggest any way in which this could be accomplished?

" 

Computationally, OOP software is slower, and uses more memory since more lines of code have to be written.

More lines of code was why it's slower to develop under OOP paradigm. OOP uses more memory because it needs to load stuff regardless of its relevance in context and keep state of the objects somewhere, etc.

This stands in contrast to declarative programming, which focuses on what the computer program should accomplish, without specifying how.

Functional languages tend to be quite specific about how to accomplish stuff. That sentence from Wikipedia is misleading.

__init__ must always be present!

No, it's optional. Though in most cases you need it.

2. In instantiating objects you refer to brackets, though this may be misleading to some who consider '[]' to be brackets. Referring to them as ""round brackets"" or ""brackets (or parentheses to some)"" may clear this up for some readers.

3. In Example: OOP in Python for finance, there is ""you'll see that there is first a initialisation,"" when I believe it should be ""you'll see that there is first an initialisation,"".

"Thanks, interesting tutorial. The ""Zero Probability Problem"" is a good hint.

I think that the example in ""Second Approach (In case of multiple features)"" is mathematically incorrect. The probability P(Play=Yes | Weather=Overcast, Temp=Mild) = 1. In equation (1) the denominator with P(Weather=Overcast, Temp=Mild) is missing. Furthermore, in equation (2), the result should be P(Weather=Overcast, Temp=Mild | Play=Yes) = P(Overcast | Yes, Mild)*P(Mild | Yes) = ... = 1/9 (just look it up in the table! => Overcast and Mild given Yes). By the way, the sum of P(Yes|O,M) + P(No|O,M) = 1 (=> he either plays or he doesn't play - there is no other option).

I also have some questions: 

Why is a LabelEncoder used? Does GaussianNB() only work with numbers?

Hi, Avinash, many thanks for your contribution via this article, it helps me a lot, truth is. I have some doubts, pls:

a. you mentioned that the input data needs to be numerical. However I am seeing that the target one was also converted via label encoding. Is that mandatory hence? 

b. does LabelEncoding works alphabetically while assigning 0, 1, 2s etc? 

c. “Let's split dataset by using function train_test_split()Additionally, you can use random_state to select records randomly.”: shouldn’t we FIRST random data and afterwards split it so that we make sure we avoid data manipulation?

"My biggest ""gottchas"" as a lone R user in an institutional Windows shop are: 1) Making R and RStudio work together when I usually don't have administrative privelages; and 2) making Git and Github work smoothly with RStudio (some influential bloggers convinced me that I should be using version control). I deal with the former by installing R in C:\R\ (e.g., C:\R\R-3.5.1) (as opposed to a default universal naming convention server location to which ""My Documents""  is re-routed) and by doing a lot of tweaking of .Rprofile and other settings files. I make sure that I do NOT obtain admin privelages when installing upgrading R, since I don't want to install in any subdirectory that I will not be able to access on a normal day-to-day basis.

"A Python variable name must begin with an alphabetic character or an underscore and may contain alphanumeric characters and an underscore. And besides, the name of the variable should not coincide with the name of the keywords in the Python language. There are not so many keywords, I remember them well because I write my paper for me with a cheat sheet, but honestly learn them easily: and, like, assert, break, class, continue, def, del, elif, else, except False, finally for, from, global, if, import, in, is, lambda, None, non-local, not or pass, raise, return, True, try, while, with, yield.

A variable stores data from one of the data types. Although this is not my specialty, but I remember that at the university we were told that there are many different types of data in Python, which are divided into categories: numbers, sequences, dictionaries, sets:

- boolean - true or false

- int - represents an integer number for storage, which uses 4 bytes in the computer's memory.

- float - represents a floating-point number, for storage of which 8 bytes are used, for example, 1.2 or 34.76.

- complex - complex numbers

- str - strings, for example ""hello"". In Python 3.x, strings represent the Unicode character set.

- bytes - a sequence of numbers in the range 0-255

- byte array - a byte array, similar to a byte with a difference that can be changed

- list 

- tuple 

- set - an unordered collection of unique objects

- frozen set is the same as a set, it just cannot change (immutable)

- dict - a dictionary in which each element has a key and a value",,Scope of Variables in Python Tutorial

The best approach for the beginner is to understand that statistical methods performed on data will   not only reveal quirky data  that should be overlooked, but also data needed to construct the model.  The model can reveal further insight into the analysis  that will solve a problem and also lead to another form of model that helps the data scientist get further insight. When the predictions  become accurate a significant amount of the time, then the frequency of the data reveal in some histogram will establish a solid evaluative feedback. That feedback can be the baseline for future data analysis on similar data-frames.

"Hi,




Thanks for the informative and clear introduction in SA.

I'm studying reaction times (button presses) of participants to a stimulus (e.g. video clip of a dangerous traffic situation).

I have an experienced and a non-experienced group. Lets say that in 59% of the cases the non-experienced group reacted to the dangerous situation while 89% of the experienced participants reacted within the time frame (e.g. 22 seconds) of the dangerous situation. 41% of the non-experienced and 11% of the experienced  group did not react to the situation or found this situation not dangerous enough to elicit a response. In normal statistics, this would mean that the pp that did not respond would have a 'NA' or would be deleted from the analysis. However, SA is recently being used for analysing these kind of data as it offers the possibility to maintain the nonresponders. But how would you insert their nonresponse times  in the datasheet? As NA, without a value for response time, or ...?

"Hi Avinash,

Thanks for this great article,  It was really useful to get the concept of RFM.  Nonetheless there was an error in the middle of your script and escalated through the rest of analysis.

When you do the aggregation, your columns will be:




 rfm.columns 

Index(['InvoiceDate', 'InvoiceNo', 'TotalPrice'], dtype='object')




Then when you change the column names,  the order of new column names should tally with the original names, but in your code the order is different,  for example. according to my code above, the new column name should be:

rfm.columns=['recency','frequency','monetary']




Because of this error, your dataframe shows monetary:325, freq:77183.60, recency:1 for customer 12346, but the correct values for this customer are: monetary: 77183.60, freq:1, recency: 325




I thinks it affected how you set the quartiles too, but anyway, I`m not sure why you changed the quartile names from [1,2,3,4] for recency to [4,3,2,1] for frequency for example:

rfm['r_quartile'] = pd.qcut(rfm['recency'], 4, ['1','2','3','4']) 

rfm['f_quartile'] = pd.qcut(rfm['frequency'], 4, ['4','3','2','1']) 

rfm['m_quartile'] = pd.qcut(rfm['monetary'], 4, ['4','3','2','1']) 

My interpretation was that our preference is lower recency and quartile 1 is showing lower recency, in the same manner we like higher freq and monetary, so we assign q1 to them, as  1 is higher rank for us. am I right on this?

"Hi Avinash,

Thanks for the post. I have one question on what customer should be included. How long  do customers need to start purchase in order to be included in RFM analysis? For example, if RFM is based on last 12 months' data and  a new customer just  started first purchase two days ago, should this new customer be included into analysis? If so, there will be low frequency and low moneytery value, but this customer could belong to a potential high value segment, since it is hard to know his behavior yet.

"I think you are doing something wrong in aggregation.

Frequency is total number of purchases as you have explained.

In (   'InvoiceNo': lambda num: len(num) ), You should not take length. Instead you should take length of unique 'InvoiceNo' of a customer.

The problem with your approach is:

If a customer buys 100 items in 1 time, his frequency is according to your code is 100
If another customer buys 100 items in 10 different times, his frequency is also 100.

What actually should be is for the first customer frequency should be 1, as he has visited only once. For the second customer, the frequency should be 10 as he has visited 10 times and he has 10 unique invoice numbers.",,Introduction to Customer Segmentation in Python

""Simply speaking, you should include the feature selection step before feeding the data to the model for training especially when you are using accuracy estimation methods such as cross-validation.

But if you perform feature selection first to prepare your data, then perform model selection and training on the selected features then it would be a blunder. ""

"" The problem is that the predictors have an unfair advantage, as they were chosen in step (1) on the basis of all of the samples.

""An iterator is an object that implements the iterator protocol (don't panic!).""

""Python has  several built-in objects, which implement the iterator protocol and you  must have seen some of these before: lists, tuples, strings,  dictionaries and even files.""

This implies that a list is an iterator, but I learn from otherwhere that it is not. The article is somewhat vague and unclear and should be updated.

"Hello,

I have heard that the output obtained through PCA analysis can be used as predictors in regression. For example, if you have two data sets: A contains the results of an experiment with each row representing a participant response, B contains (highly variable) social information about each participant in the study. I would like to perform a PCA analysis on data set B and use the resulting vectors as predictor variables in a mixed effects regression performed on data set A. In other words, I am trying to test how can social factors account for participant behavior. How would I go about including those principal components in my regression? I am familiar with mixed effects regression in R but if anybody can provide some sample code to achieve this, that would be great.

Thanks!

One question thou,  why did you not set the ngrams to be (1,2)?  For example. there are some genres that are classified as science fiction, which means the vectorizer will only count  1 for science and  1 for fiction, which when out of context, doesnt really make sense.  Perhaps there's a best practice?

I am using TF-IDF feature and Part of Speech Tag feature and train it with SVM, however I still could understand how does it work.

My dataset consists of  year, song, genre, lyric, language. 

I did tokenization with ngram (unigram and bigram) and from the result I did TF_IDF. I got the TD_IDF value per unigram/bigram. And now I am completely lost.

What suppose I do to train my data?  

Do I need to wrap my TF_IDF value to one document(per song) or just leave it like that (unigram/bigram) and then train the TF_IDF value to classify the genre?

I also want to leave a tip about explicitly identifying wanted data in the html. You were find various tags from the entire soup, but most of the time there are multiple tables as well as other tags. Looking at the example html (which, as you point out, the reader can access by right licking and selecting 'inspect') I quickly noticed that the table of interest was assigned an id with a value of 'individualResults'. Reading only this table saves headaches of unwittingly grabbing data from the wrong table. Once the intended table has been isolated the rows and columns can be looped through.

There was no way to create a goal seek procedure in python and after several tries I reverted back to excel. Especially one of the procedures with goal seek was so important for my work so I couldn’t see myself working with python. If i someday meet some skilled python programmer I will ask that person to help me create a goal seek procedure until then I am stuck with excel. :(",,Using Python to Power Spreadsheets in Data Science
Excellent article. I love how pandas reduces the number of lines of code needed to do many things. I love the data visualization aspect and learning everyday to be better at python and pandas.,,Using Python to Power Spreadsheets in Data Science
"There are many points in this article where I perk up, crack a huge smile on my face and then take a deep sigh, because there are so (so so) many things I can relate to. 




I consider myself to be a strong Excel user, and for six years, during the entirety of my post-graduation employment, I have always been required to undertake data activities and present clear management information for key decision making.




I love Excel, as I have already alluded to, I am proficient in it and consider its usage the very fibre of my work. However, I have always longed for something more. 




From the few roles I have had in the past six years, I would deem 90% of my time being taken up in some form of admin. Whether this is bringing together different data sets (exports from: SAP, Oracle/Toad, SQL, and other people’s spreadsheets); bringing consistency; cleaning, centralising, analysing and summarising the data; publishing the management information in an open and transparent manner: all this stuff is repetitive administration. Yes, it requires some brain power, some skill, some persistence (note the overlap of skills required for hacking/coding). But once I’ve cracked it, I am just turning the handle every day.




This knowledge and this feeling has, at times, left me feeling like a fraud. So I started to learn to code in Python.




This has been a colossal struggle for me. I have repeatedly questioned whether I’m cut out for coding, and often evaluated whether I truly need to learn it, because I can just carry on (being a fraud) with my Excel spreadsheets, which most of my customers enjoy.




Q: Why do I struggle with learning Python? A: Mostly, it centres around boredom. 




I use DataCamp and I think it is easily the best means for me to gain knowledge, skills, practice and exposure: I definitely believe my subscription is a worthwhile investment for my future career prospects and don’t question my value for money (I don’t work for DataCamp and am getting no brownie points for saying this – it is my genuine personal view). However, I can sit at my laptop and do exercise after exercise, using DataCamp’s hypothetical scenarios: but after about 20 minutes, the marginal returns diminish to very (very very) little learning. 




Unless I am doing projects that mean something to me, that are actual and not hypothetical, I cannot seem to engage beyond the initial 20 minutes. And this is not a criticism of the course content or structure: I am not saying the activities need to be more engaging. Indeed, many data scientists I have spoken to about this problem, tell me to switch over to Kaggle and do something I am interested in to keep my motivation and engagement. But my problem is fundamentally centred on the sheer lack of basic Python knowledge I currently poses, and my being so very near the beginning of my journey (not in terms of time, but knowledge), that I just need to continue putting in the hours and learning the essential stuff and battle my boredom.




These feelings result in serious fluctuations in my learning curve. I can spend one hour of every day in a week, actively learning. Then I can waste three weeks without touching any material, and eroding the skills of what I should have already committed to memory.




Whenever I evaluate my ambition learn data science, it stems from two angles: 1) the deep fear that my ‘fraud’ will eventually be caught, automated by some data scientist/engineer in a faraway land (where it’s cheaper for my employer to pay for a support service contract than it is to employ and accommodate me); but mostly 2) boredom of ‘turning the handle’.




I repeat for the last time: I love Excel. But I hate the repetitive admin, and when I’m bored, my mind wonders.




I’ve already (roughly) accounted for 90% of my time being taken up in Excel admin. From the remaining 10%: 5% of it is spent in (mostly redundant) meetings and phone calls; 4% of it talking to someone about what the value of my work has been, and how to access and utilise the MI I have published; but only 1% of my time in thinking about business problems and how I can engineer a solution by using the available data.




I feel I need to learn Python to get out of the 1) fear, 2) boredom and 3) redress the aforementioned percentage imbalances and increase productive time where I am thinking and engineering solutions to business problems.




Am I right? Anybody else feel the same?",,Using Python to Power Spreadsheets in Data Science

Thank you for the tutorial!,,Implementing Autoencoders in Keras: Tutorial
"First of all, thank you for the tutorial. It is indeed a very good introduction. However, I have some questions:




1. What is the benefit of using the autoencoder in the first example? Do we really use a fewer number of bits to represent images in the bottleneck? It seems that instead of one image of size 28x28 we have 128 images of size 7x7.

2.  Are downsampling and upsampling necessary in the denoising autoencoder or are there alternative architectures without a radical decrease in the image resolution in hidden layers? What is then the gain from having a lower resolution image in the hidden layer?

3. How would the denoising autoencoder generalize to the different kinds of noise, e.g. salt and pepper noise? Can both kinds of noise be easily incorporated in one network?

Thanks for a great tutorial - always interesting to see other ways of measuring performance of hyperparameter tuning then simple using cross-validation metrics, i.e. MSE or the like!

I have one clarification though,  which i strongly suggest that you change in the programming. When initiating the vector to hold the AIC/BIC values, you are growing the vector - a death sin in R. Therefore I suggest that you change 

aic <- c() to aic <- vector(""numeric"", length(lambdas_to_try))

and similarly for bic.




When that is said I really enojyed your tutorial and have found it to provide quite interesting results in that its results differ significantly from those obtained by using cv.glmnet with ""mse"" as performance metric. ",,"Regularization: Ridge, Lasso and Elastic Net"

Today it is produced in large quantities in Vietnam and we can import it fairly easily.

Your pancreas releases insulin to help transport sugar (which is a carbohydrate) to your muscles and gain strength. But that soda contains much more than you need.

Below is the reason and correction for it:

I ran the program again and found that the CSV file that is created in the tutorial is numbering the transactions by row like 1,2,3 and so on. This is the reason there result is not being displayed correct.  

To correct this you can either do manual correction or through code:

For manual correction: In file 'market_basket_transactions.csv',  which is the file created, remove the column with serial numbers (first column) using Excel or a spreadsheet program.

Using Code:  Change the following line of code:

write.csv(transactionData,""D:/Documents/market_basket_transactions.csv"", quote = FALSE, row.names = TRUE)

to

write.csv(transactionData,""D:/Documents/market_basket_transactions.csv"", quote = FALSE, row.names = FALSE)

The row.name=TRUE is causing the serial numbers, so just set it to FALSE and the CSV will not have serial numbers in it. You will get correct results.",,Market Basket Analysis using R

Good explaination, some questions though,

- IN your training set while you are encoding you have handled to encode only categorical values by iterating  and ensuring the get_dummies has only categorical values

How are you ensuring only categorical values are getting encoded while passing the Json format input data? I see that the API code has no conditions to consider only categorical values.

Doesn't this impact the model? Also how do we specify only the column names to be encoded if the input is in json? In your example if I have to encode only Sex, Embarked and Survived, how do I do it?

In the ""Multiple If Conditions"" section the  multi-ifs in the dict comprehension are written as:

and then in the for loop example the equivalent is written as:

if (v>=2 and v%2 == 0 and v%3 == 0):

In both  np.hsplit() and np.vsplit(), the second argument is in fact not the index at which to split the array, but rather the equal number of parts in which the array must be split. This means we can't just supply any arbitrary number as the second argument...it depends upon the shape of our array. In this case my_stacked_array has shape (2,8) which means it can be split horizontally into two arrays of equal shape (2,4) each or it can be split vertically into two arrays of equal shape (1,8) each.

Great Tutorial. Thanks for taking us through tensorflow. I have a few doubts.

1. What are all the Loss Functions & Optimizing Algorithms. How to select one based on the task (i.e.) where to use which ?

2. Graph Function - where to define it ?

3. How many layers are there in this ? can we increase or decrease the number of layers?

4. I am getting an error as ""Not enough dimensions"" while trying to plot the image using ""plt.imshow(image, cmap=""gray"")"". This error occurs only when i use ""images28 = rgb2gray(images28)""

5. I tried using the same example, changed the images to my images and tried. I am getting Memory Error. Any help is much Appreciated!!

In the first model, the input layer had a size of 12 and the second layer had 8 hidden units. The second model had 64 and you suggest increasing it to 128 as a possible way to improve the model. Do they need to be multiples of 8? I don't see any other connection. Any guidance would be great. Thanks!",,Keras Tutorial: Deep Learning in Python
