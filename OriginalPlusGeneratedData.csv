"I enjoyed reading this tutorial and learned new things. I have a question in these lines that I think was not answered. Sometimes, I use loops to do an iterative task, and I store the results in a vector. Is there a more efficient alternative?

for (k in 1:m) {

There is one aspect I don't understand though:  the article suggests that the clustering is 'impressive' because it maps on to the real world boundaries, to some extent. This doesn't seem to me to be the measure of success (and I see in response to another question the author does say that any similarity is actually incidental). 

Wouldn't it be more interesting if the algorithm showed clusters that bore no resemblance at all to geographical boundaries, and isn't this more the purpose of the clustering (ie to uncover groupings that we weren't already aware of in the data)?",0.0

"Very nice tutorial! Thanks Thushan!

1D Linear Loss Function Plots. One simple and lightweight method to plot loss function is to choose two sets of parameters θi and θf , and plot the values of the loss function L(θ) along the line connecting these two sets. We can parameterize this line by choosing a scalar parameter α and defining the weighted average θα = (1 − α)θi + αθf , and compute the function f(θ) = L(θα). Here we choose θi as the randomly assigned initial weights and θf the final well-trained model weights in Part (1) above (global minimum, hopefully).

To calculate the loss function, we fed a predetermined test or training dataset (which should be consistent for the whole process of loss function evaluation) to the model determined by θα and compute the loss function. With sufficient (α,f(α)) points, we can display the loss function in 1D space.

(b). 2D Loss Contour Plots. In this approach, one first chooses a parameter set θ∗, which can be the final parameter set θf , to be used as the reference center of the 2D loss plot to be generated, and then chooses two direction vectors,δ and η (with dimensions compatible with θ). One then plots a function of the form f(α, β) = L(θ∗ + αδ + βη).

in the (α,β) 2D (surface) space. α and β are real scalars. δ and η could be two randomly generated vectors (with proper normalization (see Notes below). This approach was used to explore the trajectories of different minimization methods. Again, θ∗ could be the final well-trained model weights from Part (1). Similar to Part 2(a), we can show the 2D loss landscape.




Could you suggest any way in which this could be accomplished?

         self._batch_size = batch_size

         self._num_unroll = num_unroll

I'm guessing prices is the total number of price entries
Not sure what price_length is. I thought maybe it's number of prices per batch, but it doesn't look like it... Like if you have a set [1,2,3,4,5] with batch size = 2, then you have 4 batches, each with two elements. Where you get the number of batches from (num of prices - num of prices per batch + 1)
Isn't num_unroll just the number of batches? At least that's what it looks like from the example. But then you also have segments, which is what?


Also, where is it predicting the future price exactly? The graphs seem to just show the current days' prices. Unless it's just plotted a day back.

And lastly, how do I get back the original prices? I tried doing inverse_transform but it didn't quite work.

"Thanks, interesting tutorial. The ""Zero Probability Problem"" is a good hint.

I think that the example in ""Second Approach (In case of multiple features)"" is mathematically incorrect. The probability P(Play=Yes | Weather=Overcast, Temp=Mild) = 1. In equation (1) the denominator with P(Weather=Overcast, Temp=Mild) is missing. Furthermore, in equation (2), the result should be P(Weather=Overcast, Temp=Mild | Play=Yes) = P(Overcast | Yes, Mild)*P(Mild | Yes) = ... = 1/9 (just look it up in the table! => Overcast and Mild given Yes). By the way, the sum of P(Yes|O,M) + P(No|O,M) = 1 (=> he either plays or he doesn't play - there is no other option).

I also have some questions: 

Why is a LabelEncoder used? Does GaussianNB() only work with numbers?
I'm a bit confused about the independence condition. Does the Naive Bayes Algorithm due to the independence assumption indeed use P(O,M|Yes) = P(O|Yes)*P(M|Yes) as it is written in eq. (2) of the second example?",0.0

I want to know if it is possible to input a multi dimensional time series signal to this model and get a multidimensional (multiple features) output signal from this model? if so how would be the configuration of the tensorflow ?  I guess the last layer which is a regression layer can be set up to give a multidimensional output but I wnt to know how the configuration of the batches and these sort of things would change regarding to many-many configuration.

"As someone who has been developing for a few years but is pretty new to python I've found this work to be very insightful and well explained! Oddly enough the only thing I can't figure out is how to read the graph at the very end.  Would you be able to explain what the lines creating the graph are doing?  

For example the last red line in the Best Predictions overtime graph starts at a high and dips down mirroring the actual price movement direction. Do I interpret that as it knew there was going to be a drop but not necessarily what the price would be? Lastly after point 12,000 there are no red lines. Is that because they weren't graphed or they overlap so well with the blue lines that we just don't visually see them?

Computationally, OOP software is slower, and uses more memory since more lines of code have to be written.

More lines of code was why it's slower to develop under OOP paradigm. OOP uses more memory because it needs to load stuff regardless of its relevance in context and keep state of the objects somewhere, etc.

This stands in contrast to declarative programming, which focuses on what the computer program should accomplish, without specifying how.

Functional languages tend to be quite specific about how to accomplish stuff. That sentence from Wikipedia is misleading.

__init__ must always be present!

No, it's optional. Though in most cases you need it.

"Hi Sir !
Thank you for your tutorial

I have some doubt that maybe you can clear out.

Firstly, after I read your explanation, I though the code will predict the 50 steps ahead of time.
But, I think your code is in the end just predicting a one step-ahead.

Your num_unrolling is how many steps back you run to get info from training data, to predict the one step ahead thing.
From there you run prediction to the future for n_predict_once times.
At this point, maybe this is what you mean by predicting 50 steps ahead, because n_predict_once is 50
But, if it work that way, then your prediction is hardly to even reach 50% accuracy.
Since we predict n_predict_once ahead, then I should observe only the tail from the red line, which is the 50th prediction ahead.
This value is in the end the 50th steps ahead prediction which we want.

So, if we compare the tail of each red line with the real price movement.
There are many times, where the red tail is going down while the price movement is up, and so the opposite.

In short, I wonder, what exactly you mean by ""able to predict stock price behavior correctly most of the time"" ?
Because it was not so.
Am I missing something ?

This tutorial has been very helpful.  I just started working on a new R package that integrates Python through the Rstudio reticulate package and I wanted to make sure I knew how  to create better documentation and I was also just implementing TravisCI for testing.  Your method of doing an auto-build and pushing the pkgdown output to Github is extremely useful.  It is also good to see how easy it is to do automated builds with Travis CI.     I think DataCamp should add a course for building packages in R so that data science teams can interactively learn how to build packages accurately and ensure that they are well tested.  This tutorial should be a piece of a Package development course in my opinion.

"Hi Sejal!

Great Tutorial:) 

I need some guidance, I am working on a project for a client, well not really working but it's part of my master's curriculum. The data set are real world data.  I have bunch of ordinal categorial variables (~20) as inputs and now I would need to cluster them to create market segmentation. These variables are actually scaled variables i.e. on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 being the lowest and 5 the highest range on that scale. While designing the survey questionnaire, we had ensured to maintained the uniformity i.e. all these ordinal categorical variables have fixed scale i.e. 1 to 5 to avoid any false positives and less data transformation. In short, each question is framed to address different aspects of consumer buying behaviors in short.

Now, I am trying to explore ways where I can form clusters using these variables. I also have their demographics data(Age,Gender, Income, Education, etc.,). I have never worked on ordinal categorical variables to create cluster as my understanding is limited to numerical/continuous variables only as k-means works really well based on euclidean distance principle.

Could you please suggest a way to work on this?

Appreciate your help!

Thanks!

"Thanks for the write up. I have been working on time series prediction for around year now,.

I have some questions in your current implementation:


When you have compared the results noted as predicted and actual data in the graphs, was true data given as input for the future predictions? I mean for the future predictions, as you are doing single step prediction, say to predict values of a day after tomorrow I will have to have tomorrow's data (assuming each time step interval is a day), but in practice we don't really have the true data of tomorrow, though we can obviously use predictions of tomorrow from the today's data but there would be some error in it, which dramatically increases as we go farther in the future to predict. Though multi step predictions work better but are not as good as when we do predictions based on true data, also results are not really robust and are very much depend upon the step size. ",0.0

First of all, thanks for the article, its very interesting and the example is well explained. 

I'm not very familiarized with the NYC boroughs, but looking at some maps and at your example, I don't know if I'm understanding it well. 

I think that with k-means,  your are dividing your data (latitude and longitude) into 5 different groups. But this groups calculated by k-means, really don't match with the boroughs, do they?

I guess you are assuming that they are similar enough to the boroughs to assume each one of this calculated groups represent a borough? For instance Queens, in the map representation it is identified with the purple dots, but looking at a NYC map, this area looks more like Brooklyn than Queens.
